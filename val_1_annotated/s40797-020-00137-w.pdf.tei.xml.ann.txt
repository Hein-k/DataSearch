The | objective | of | this | paper | is | twofold | firstly | it | analyzes | the | evolution | of | frauds | in | the | Italian | wine | value | chain | over | the | period | 2007 | 2015 | and | then | using | a | properly | disaggregated | social | accounting | matrix | SAM | of | the | Italian | economy | it | simulates | the | impact | of | wine | frauds | on | the | national | economy | in | terms | of | growth | employment | value | added | and | income | The | wine | industry | is | the | sector | most | exposed | to | frauds | within | the | Italian | agro | food | system | accounting | for | 88 | of | total | value | of | seized | agrofood | outputs | Most | irregularities | 95 | are | made | by | only | three | agents | specifically | individual | wineries | bottlers | wholesalers | and | retailers | We | estimated | industry | specific | SAM | multipliers | to | assess | the | share | of | the | Italian | economy | depending | on | irregular | wine | production | These | activities | account | for | 11.5 | of | specialized | permanent | crop | farms | output | and | over | 25 | of | wine | industry | output | This | is | a | sign | of | vulnerability | of | the | wine | industry | should | a | food | scandal | scare | determine | a | drop | in | consumers | demand | the | negative | effect | on | production | activities | of | these | sectors | may | be | large | The | SAM | was | also | used | to | perform | an | impact | analysis | adopting | a | counterfactual | approach | Results | show | a | slightly | positive | increase | of | value | added | 6 | million | euro | along | with | an | overall | decrease | in | the | activity | level | an | output | loss | of | 406 | million | euro | and | more | than | six | thousand | full | time | jobs | lost | This | contractionary | effect | can | be | explained | with | fraud | rents | Indeed | the | extra | profits | from | frauds | do | not | activate | the | economy | circular | flow | as | most | of | them | leak | out | to | exogenous | accounts | such | as | the | public | administration | and | the | rest | of | the | world

The | Italian | agri | food | system | is | one | of | the | most | important | components | of | the | Made | in | Italy | In | 2018 | the | agricultural | sector | produced | outputs | valued | 55.9 | billion | euro | employing | 1.2 | million | labor | units | and | exporting | some | 6.8 | billion | euro | of | agricultural | goods | ISTAT | 2019a | b | ISMEA | 2019a | while | the | food | industry | turnover | peaked | at | 140 | billion | euro | with | 385 | thousand | employees | and | export | exceeding | 35.1 | billion | euro | which | ranks | food | as | the | second | Italian | largest | exporting | sector | in | 2018 | ISMEA |  | 2019a | Federalimentare | 2019a | In | Italy | the | wine | sector | is | the | third | most | important | agri | food | sector | after | dairy | and | meat | in | terms | of | production | with | an | industrial | turnover | exceeding | 13.2 | billion | euro | and | more | than | 13 | thousand | employees | in | the | wine | industry | but | it | is | the | most | important | agri | food | exporting | sector | accounting | for | 6.2 | billion | euro | in | 2018 | i.e. | 14.8 | of | total | agri | food | export | mostly | represented | by | high | quality | wines | with | geographical | indication | ISMEA | 2019b | 1 | In | fact | Italy | ranks | first | at | world | level | in | terms | of | number | of | geographically | denominated | wines | with | 408 | Protected | Designation | of | Origin | DOP | and | 118 | Protected | Geographical | Indications | IGP | wines | FEDERDOC | 2019 | 2 | accounting | for | 58.2 | of | wine | production | and | for | an | astonishing | 88.2 | of | wine | export | in | 2018

The | large | share | of | high | quality | wine | produced | by | the | Italian | wine | industry | the | increasing | reputation | of | Italian | wines | on | domestic | and | foreign | markets | that | fetch | significant | price | premiums | and | the | large | number | of | small | production | units | contribute | to | create | significant | opportunities | for | fraud | that | is | an | intentional | illegal | act | made | for | sake | of | economic | gain | Spink | and | Moyer | 2011 | 3 | -in | the | wine | industry | In | fact | wine | ranks | first | by | far | among | agri | food | value | chains | in | terms | of | number | of | detected | irregularities | and | value | of | seized | products | ICQRF | 2019 | However | though | food | frauds | have | recently | drawn | considerable | attention | because | of | the | growing | risk | of | food | fraud | Avery | 2014 | 4 | frauds | in | the | wine | value | chain | is | a | neglected | topic | Besides | the | yearly | reports | of | inspection | bodies | which | disseminate | information | about | monitoring | activities | the | literature | on | the | topic | is | scanty | INEA | 2011 | Menghini | and | Fabbri | 2013 | Importantly | there | is | a | fundamental | gap | in | the | economic | literature | in | so | far | no | comprehensive | analysis | of | frauds | in | the | wine | sector | in | Italy | has | been | carried | out | so | far | and | specifically | no | quantitative | assessment | of | the | economic | impact | of | wine | frauds | on | the | Italian | economy

The | overall | objective | of | this | paper | is | to | shed | light | on | the | phenomenon | of | frauds | in | the | wine | sector | adopting | a | value | chain | perspective | that | is | analyzing | grape | production | as | well | as | wine | making | and | distribution | up | to | final | consumption | This | will | be | done | using | as | primary | source | the | data | on | inspection | activities | carried | out | by | the | Central | Inspectorate | for | Agri | food | Quality | Protection | and | Fraud | Repression | Ispettorato | Centrale | per | la | Qualità | e | la | Repressione | delle | Frodi | ICQRF | of | the | Italian | Ministry | of | Agriculture | MIPAAF | Specifically | we | will | i | analyze | the | evolution | of | the | fraud | in | the | wine | value | chain | over | the | period | 2007 | 2015 | ii | provide | some | insights | on | how | the | phenomenon | is | distributed | by | geographical | location | and | value | chain | stages | and | iii | assess | the | economic | importance | of | frauds | estimating | how | large | is | the | irregular | economy | linked | to | fraudulent | activities | in | the | wine | value | chain | and | what | is | its | impact | on | the | Italian | economy | in | terms | of | output | value | added | employment | and | household | income | The | impact | analysis | will | be | pursued | building | a | properly | disaggregated | social | accounting | matrix | SAM | of | the | Italian | economy | to | simulate | the | effect | of | fraudulent | activities | perpetrated | by | the | operators | along | the | wine | value | chain | In | fact | the | database | provided | by | ICQRF | refers | only | to | fraudulent | activities | carried | out | within | the | country | Because | of | this | lack | of | data | fraudulent | activities | such | as | the | import | of | counterfeited | agri | food | products | or | the | so | called | Italian | sounding | are | not | accounted | for | in | the | analysis | 5 | The | paper | is | organized | as | follows | Section | 2 | briefly | describes | how | the | wine | value | chain | is | structured | in | Italy | Section | 3 | summarizes | the | most | common | frauds | in | the | wine | value | chain | Section | 4 | briefly | recalls | what | is | a | SAM | and | proposes | a | methodology | to | carry | out | an | impact | evaluation | of | food | frauds | in | a | SAM | counterfactual | framework | Section | 5 | explains | how | the | SAM | of | the | Italian | economy | and | the | vector | of | wine | fraud | shocks | has | been | built | Section | 6 | discusses | the | results | of | the | empirical | analysis | Section | 7 | concludes

The | Italian | wine | value | chain | is | made | by | a | complex | cobweb | of | material | and | financial | flows | connecting | vineyards | to | final | consumption | Leaving | aside | the | exchange | with | foreign | markets | involving | import | of | bulk | wines | accounting | for | no | more | than | 5 | of | total | domestic | wine | availability | and | export | of | bulk | and | bottled | wine | accounting | for | 42 | of | total | domestic | wine | production | ISMEA | 2019b | the | wine | value | chain | can | be | broken | down | into | four | main | stages | Fig | 1 | that | are | the | production | of | raw | material | grape | producing | farms | wine | making | wineries | packaging | and | logistics | bottling | transport | storage | firms | and | distribution | to | final | consumers | represented | by | channels | as | different | as | the | large | modern | distribution | retailers | and | the | hotel | restaurants | and | catering | Ho | Re | Ca | channel | Besides | the | agents | involved | in | production | processing | packaging | and | distribution | there | are | other | categories | of | agents | involved | in | services | associated | with | production | such | as | nurseries | wine | yeast | producers | oenotechnics | and | marketing | such | as | exporters | importers | certification | agencies | communication | agencies | who | play | an | increasingly | important | role

In | terms | of | fraud | risk | the | most | important | stages | are | the | first | three | i.e. | grape | production | processing | and | packaging | The | three | most | important | operators | in | these | stages | are | grape | producers | wine | makers | and | bottlers | According | to | the | latest | available | data | Malorgio | et | al | 2011 | Mazzarino | and | Corsi | 2014 | MIPAAF | 2017 | ISMEA | 2019b | these | three | categories | total | around | 320 | thousand | operators | Table | 1 | The | vast | majority | of | them | 310 | thousands | are | grape | producers | who | can | in | turn | be | broken | down | into | individual | farmers | representing | 54 | of | total | farmers | involved | in | the | value | chain | and | accounting | for | 52 | of | the | grapes | produced | in | Italy | and | farmers | who | are | members | of | a | wine | making | cooperative | accounting | for | 46 | of | total | grape | producers | and | contributing | with | a | share | of | 48 | to | total | domestic | production | of | grapes | for | wine | making | Mazzarino | and | Corsi | 2014 | The | grape | supply | is | highly | fragmented | with | a | myriad | of | small | farms | averaging | only | 2.1 | hectare | each | ISMEA | 2019b | Only | farms | whose | owners | are | cooperative | members | feature | some | aggregation | of | their | individual | supply | The | grand | total | accounts | for | 42,000 | farmers | who | are | also | wine | makers | providing | their | whole | production | to | the | coop | winery | they | belong | to | 6 | However | also | in | this | case | the | farming | size | is | generally | small | MIPAAF | 2017

The | processing | phase | accounts | for | 44 | thousand | wineries | Most | of | them | 42 | thousand | are | small | farm | wineries | accounting | for | one | fifth | of | total | domestic | wine | production | Usually | farm | wineries | are | integrated | with | grape | farms | that | process | their | own | grapes | supplemented | sometimes | with | purchased | grapes | In | order | to | be | economically | viable | many | small | wineries | integrate | functions | other | than | wine | making | such | as | direct | sale | Similarly | rather | than | bottling | their | own | wine | these | small | wineries | usually | resort | to | mobile | and/or | fixed | bottling | plants | which | quite | frequently | can | also | provide | trading | services | mostly | at | wholesale | stage | An | important | segment | of | the | processing | stage | is | represented | by | coop | wineries | These | wineries | process | the | grapes | provided | by | cooperative | members | but | may | also | integrate | their | own | provision | of | raw | material | by | purchasing | grapes | from | individual | farmers | through | the | spot | market | Although | coop | wineries | total | only | 518 | cooperatives | they | account | for | one | half | of | total | domestic | wine | production | The | remaining | share | of | domestic | wine | production | 29 | is | produced | by | industrial | wineries

Packaging | is | the | most | concentrated | stage | within | the | value | chain | primarily | because | of | the | costly | investment | required | to | establish | bottling | lines | Bottlers | account | for | roughly | 8000 | operators | made | almost | exclusively | by | industrial | and | cooperative | wineries | plus | a | small | proportion | of | farm | wineries | Malorgio | et | al | 2011 | that | integrate | wine | making | with | bottling | Bottling | operators | are | quite | heterogeneous | in | terms | of | vertical | integration | along | the | wine | value | chain | roughly | one | fifth | of | them | being | purely | Fig | 2 | Wineries | orientation | in | terms | of | product | quality | characteristics | Source | elaboration | on | data | from | Malorgio | et | al | 2011 |  | bottlers | while | the | rest | integrating | functions | other | than | bottling | such | as | grape | processing | into | wine | According | to | Mazzarino | and | Corsi | 2014 | bottlers | are | increasingly | providing | also | wholesale | services | The | bottlers | wholesalers | perform | a | double | function | from | one | hand | they | connect | wine | producers | to | the | stage | of | final | distribution | on | the | other | hand | they | are | responsible | of | transportation | and/or | storage | of | wine | sometimes | going | downstream | up | to | final | sale | which | may | include | also | exports

From | the | structural | viewpoint | the | Italian | wine | value | chain | is | characterized | by | high | fragmentation | of | involved | farms | firms | At | the | same | time | the | value | chain | is | increasingly | concentrated | moving | from | production | to | processing | and | packaging | In | terms | of | conduct | the | wine | making | units | whether | integrated | or | not | show | different | orientation | in | terms | of | quality | characteristics | of | their | output | Fig | 2 | Farm | and | cooperative | wineries | are | more | specialized | in | high | quality | wines | such | as | DOP | and | IGP | wines | while | most | of | industrial | wineries | 68 | produce | only | conventional | wine

Although | food | fraud | is | a | hot | topic | in | politically | debates | and | news | headlines | frauds | in | the | Italian | wine | value | chain | have | not | attracted | the | scholarly | interest | so | far | To | the | best | of | our | knowledge | there | are | only | a | couple | of | studies | dealing | with | this | issue | INEA | 2011 | published | a | report | analyzing | the | wine | olive | oil | and | dairy | value | chains | in | order | to | support | ICQRF | activity | planning | However | the | report | relies | only | on | a | qualitative | analysis | of | secondary | data | and | expert | judgments | to | draw | some | suggestions | on | how | ICQRF | monitoring | activities | could | be | improved | Menghini | and | Fabbri | 2013 | edited | a | report | on | the | traceability | in | the | wine | value | chain | that | analyzes | the | organization | of | monitoring | activities | in | the | value | chain | However | this | study | is | mostly | a | discussion | of | current | practices | rather | than | a | comprehensive | analysis | of | the | issues | at | stake | It | emphasizes | the | key | role | of | the | inspection | systems | for | the | wellbeing | of | consumers | as | well | as | producers | Iaderosa | 2013 | and | the | need | to | protect | primarily | DOP | and | IGP | wines | Fabbri | 2013 | Rosellini | and | Fabbri | 2013

Experts | and | operators | within | the | value | chain | acknowledge | that | frauds | are | pervasive | highly | differentiated | and | perpetrated | at | different | stages | of | the | value | chain | Indeed | over | the | last | decades | several | factors | have | contributed | to | expand | the | determinants | of | the | socalled | fraud | triangle | model | originally | proposed | by | Cressey | 1953 | 7 | thus | providing | increased | room | for | fraudulent | activities | We | refer | to | factors | as | diverse | as | the | increased | competition | in | domestic | and | world | markets | the | increased | complexity | of | globalized | value | chains | the | high | level | of | sophistication | of | many | production | processes | and | the | global | recession | and | its | aftermaths | As | a | result | the | share | of | irregular | product | and | the | value | of | seizures | in | the | wine | value | chain | have | been | increasing | over | the | last | years | Rocchi | et | al | 2020

Both | experts | and | statistical | evidence | show | that | the | most | important | frauds | in | the | value | chain | involve | i | sophistication | such | as | sugar | alcohol | addition | flavoring | use | of | wine | processing | by | products | such | as | the | wine | dregs | use | of | grapes | other | than | the | grapes | declared | in | the | label | etc | and | ii | partial | or | total | falsification | of | DOP | and | IGP | wines | through | not | compliance | with | production | codes | incorrect | DOP | IGP | labeling | incorrect | administrative | rules | on | process | documentation | and | quality | certification | etc | ICQRF | 2019 | While | the | first | group | includes | practices | that | can | be | potentially | harmful | to | human | health | the | second | category | is | generally | much | less | harmful | but | has | generally | greater | economic | impact | INEA | 2011 | In | terms | of | agents | of | frauds | the | first | category | is | generally | confined | to | the | agents | involved | in | the | processing | phase | i.e. | wine | makers | while | the | second | category | is | spread | throughout | the | value | chain | Since | the | opportunity | to | make | fraud | depends | on | the | level | of | commercialization | of | the | relevant | agents | it | is | likely | that | the | second | group | of | frauds | is | more | concentrated | with | agents | that | perform | bottling | and | distribution | of | wines | especially | exporting | firms | to | take | the | highest | advantage | from | the | reputation | of | Italian | wines | abroad | De | Franceschi | 2016 | Actually | most | frauds | in | the | wine | supply | chain | are | a | combination | of | these | two | forms | of | fraudulent | behavior

For | the | purpose | of | the | analysis | to | be | carried | out | in | this | study | a | food | fraud | exists | whenever | an | ICQRF | inspected | product | features | any | kind | of | irregularity | no | matter | if | it | leads | to | the | product | seizure | or | to | other | administrative | penalties | such | as | fines | and | warnings | 8 | Any | product | featuring | alteration | adulteration | sophistication | or | falsifica | tion | is | identified | as | irregular | product | while | the | subset | of | irregular | products | that | are | withdrawn | from | the | market | is | identified | as | seized | product | 9 | Finally | the | agent | that | commits | fraud | is | called | irregular | establishment

However | the | ICQRF | dataset | only | partially | mirrors | the | structure | of | the | wine | value | chain | as | reported | in | Fig | 1 | because | of | some | limitations | in | the | information | provided | On | the | one | hand | it | is | impossible | to | single | out | industrial | wineries | and | farm | wineries | because | no | such | information | is | available | and | no | data | are | available | on | business | dimensions | Similarly | no | information | about | the | different | typologies | of | retailing | i.e. | traditional | retailers | vs. | modern | distribution | is | reported | Furthermore | because | of | the | integration | of | several | functions | at | packaging | stage | all | establishments | performing | storage | transportation | wholesaling | and | bottling | have | been | considered | under | bottlers | wholesalers | On | the | other | hand | there | are | some | firms | providing | services | to | wine | making | firms | that | are | inspected | and | it | is | worth | to | keep | them | separate | from | other | actors | In | short | we | end | up | with | a | simplified | structure | of | the | wine | value | chain | including | the | following | actors | individual | wineries | farm | as | well | as | industrial | cooperative | wineries | bottlers | wholesalers | service | providers | retailers | and | Ho | Re | Ca

Figure | 3 | shows | how | the | ICQRF | inspection | activities | have | been | distributed | at | different | stages | of | the | value | chain | over | the | period | 2007 | 2015 | The | distribution | of | inspections | reflects | both | the | size | of | agents | at | different | stages | as | well | as | the | ICQRF | expectations | about | the | likelihood | of | making | frauds | In | fact | about | two | thirds | of | inspections | are | carried | out | at | the | level | of | processing | However | the | bulk | of | these | inspections | targets | individual | wineries | while | inspected | cooperative | wineries | account | only | for | a | trivial | 0.6 | of | the | total | Retailing | come | second | as | proportion | of | inspections | with | about | one | fifth | of | total | and | third | come | the | bottlers | wholesalers | with | some | 11 | of | total

The | highest | share | of | irregularities | is | among | individual | wineries | accounting | for | more | than | three | quarter | of | total | irregularities | a | proportion | that | is | noticeably | higher | than | that | of | inspections | This | confirms | the | wine | processing | phase | as | the | most | critical | stage | in | terms | of | fraud | opportunities | cf | Sect | 3.1 | A | share | of | irregularities | largely | in | line | with | the | inspection | rate | 11.5 | vs. | 10.2 | respectively | applies | also | to | bottlers | wholesalers | with | bottling | and | transportation | showing | a | higher | intensity | of | irregularities | as | compared | to | storage | and | wholesaling | Retailing | and | Ho | Re | Ca | show | considerably | lower | shares | of | irregularities | Indeed | in | most | cases | these | agents | are | not | responsible | for | the | irregularities | detected | at | their | level | that | are | traced | back | to | the | responsible | agent | upstream | the | value | chain

To | shed | light | on | the | intensity | of | frauds | along | the | value | chain | we | calculate | various | indicators | at | different | stages | Fig | 4 | The | ratio | of | irregular | establishments | to | inspected | establishments | is | the | highest | among | service | providers | 36 | whose | number | of | inspections | do | not | exceed | on | average | 2 | of | total | inspections | The | ratio | ranges | between | 22 | and | 26 | among | cooperative | wineries | individual | wineries | and | bottlers | wholesalers | Retailers | and | Ho | Re | Ca | operators | have | both | lower | ratios | about | 5 | The | distribution | in | terms | of | seizure | value | mirrors | that | of | irregularities | with | individual | wineries | bottlers | wholesalers | and | retailers | accounting | for | almost | total | seizures | Footnote | 8 | continued | important | information | for | wine | fraud | analysis | that | we | deem | important | to | disclose | to | the | interested | reader | Therefore | we | perform | the | analysis | for | both | seized | and | irregular | products

A | SAM | is | a | comprehensive | and | disaggregated | representation | of | the | transactions | within | an | economy | in | a | matrix | form | Each | sector | of | the | economy | an | industry | the | market | for | a | given | commodity | the | current | account | of | a | given | institution | and | so | on | is | represented | by | a | row | column | couple | recording | the | relative | flows | As | in | a | double | keeping | accounting | system | the | totals | of | inflows | row | and | outflows | column | of | each | sector | must | balance

The | SAM | model | is | a | natural | extension | of | the | Input | Output | model | originally | proposed | by | Leontief | 1936 | to | analyze | the | technical | interdependencies | in | the | production | system | SAMs | are | the | empirical | ground | base | of | a | wide | spectrum | of | multi | sector | empirical | models | Round | 2003 | representing | the | structural | interrelationships | existing | among | production | income | distribution | final | consumption | and | capital | formation

The | core | of | a | SAM | model | is | the | matrix | of | direct | expenditure | coefficients | B | that | is | the | matrix | of | coefficients | obtained | dividing | each | single | entry | of | the | SAM | by | the | corresponding | column | total | The | size | and | the | structure | of | the | matrix | B | depends | on | the | disaggregation | of | accounts | in | the | original | SAM | as | well | as | on | the | adopted | closure | As | usual | for | single | country | models | we | assume | the | small | economy | hypothesis | consider- | ing | the | Government | and | the | exchanges | with | the | rest | of | the | world | as | exogenous | The | process | of | capital | formation | is | also | assumed | as | exogenous | as | our | research | question | focuses | on | short | run | not | dynamic | impacts | The | resulting | of | matrix | B | including | all | endogenous | accounts | is | composed | by | the | following | blocks

where | S | is | the | n | m | industry | by | commodity | matrix | showing | the | share | of | each | commodity | that | is | produced | by | each | industry | A | is | the | m | n | matrix | showing | the | value | of | inputs | of | each | commodity | per | dollar | worth | of | industry | output | V | is | the | v | n | matrix | of | coefficients | of | primary | distribution | of | value | added | to | production | factors | D | is | the | d | v | matrix | of | coefficients | of | primary | income | distribution | from | factors | to | institutions | F | is | the | m | c | matrix | of | supply | of | commodities | to | consumption | functions | C | is | the | c | d | matrix | of | final | consumption | expenditure | coefficients | of | endogenous | institutions | 10 | and | T | is | the | d | d | matrix | of | coefficients | representing | transactions | among | institutions | All | other | blocks | are | zero | blocks | of | conformable | dimensions

A | generic | SAM | linear | model | Miller | and | Blair | 2009 | can | be | written | in | matrix | form | as | follows

where | y | is | the | vector | of | totals | and | x | the | vector | of | exogenous | inflows | towards | endogenous | accounts

The | solution | of | the | system | 1 | maps | the | vector | x | of | exogenous | components | to | the | vector | y | of | totals | of | endogenous | accounts | through | the | matrix | M | of | SAM | multipliers

where | I | is | the | identity | matrix | Equation | 2 | shows | that | in | SAM | models | the | activation | of | the | economy | linearly | depends | on | the | magnitude | of | a | vector | of | exogenous | inflows | towards | endogenous | accounts | This | relationship | holds | also | in | difference

where | dx | is | a | vector | of | changes | in | exogenous | injections | representing | a | given | scenario | to | be | assessed | The | entries | of | matrix | M | can | be | interpreted | as | Leontevian | Keneysian | multipliers | as | the | model | is | closed | towards | consumptions | and | allows | to | account | not | only | for | the | multiplier | effects | generated | by | inter | industry | linkages | but | also | for | the | additional | impacts | induced | by | income | distribution | and | final | expenditure | In | this | sense | SAM | models | provide | a | more | comprehensive | account | of | multiplier | effect | than | the | input | output | ones | 11 | Moreover | the | inclusion | of | households | as | an | endogenous | sector | allows | to | model | how | the | distributive | structure | of | the | economy | is | likely | to | affect | the | impacts | of | exogenous | shocks | Roland | Holst | and | Sancho | 1992 | These | are | the | basic | motivations | to | use | a | SAM | rather | than | an | input | output | framework | for | our | analysis

The | simulations | carried | out | to | assess | the | impact | of | frauds | in | the | wine | value | chain | refer | to | each | of | the | two | terms | on | the | right | hand | side | in | Eq | 3 | The | first | simulation | uses | the | fraudulent | wine | output | value | estimated | according | to | the | data | provided | by | ICQRF | both | seizures | and | other | irregular | products | as | a | vector | of | exogenous | shocks | dx | to | be | injected | into | the | model | keeping | M | constant | We | can | interpret | the | dependence | of | wine | demand | on | irregular | productions | as | a | measure | of | the | vulnerability | of | the | wine | value | chain | to | scandals | scares | especially | considering | that | the | demand | for | quality | wines | is | largely | driven | by | reputation | In | this | case | the | larger | the | share | of | the | final | demand | supplied | by | fraudulent | products | the | higher | the | risk | of | a | system | disruption

The | second | simulation | adopts | a | counterfactual | approach | Based | on | the | structure | of | the | interdependencies | within | the | economy | represented | by | the | matrix | M | and | using | additional | information | from | secondary | sources | and | key | informants | a | new | counterfactual | matrix | of | SAM | multipliers | M | representing | the | Italian | economy | as | if | there | were | no | frauds | can | be | derived | This | makes | possible | to | evaluate | the | impact | of | wine | frauds | c | by | subtracting | the | level | of | activation | that | would | be | achieved | should | the | farms | firms | in | the | wine | value | chain | be | fully | compliant | that | is | not | making | frauds | from | the | actual | level | of | activation | of | the | Italian | economy | as | represented | in | the | original | SAM

where | x | is | the | vector | of | actual | exogenous | inflows | towards | all | endogenous | accounts | y | is | the | vector | of | totals | of | actual | endogenous | accounts | and | y | is | the | vector | of | totals | of | endogenous | accounts | that | would | be | observed | should | the | production | system | be | fully | compliant

Developing | a | counterfactual | in | a | SAM | framework | requires | information | on | frauds | that | are | by | definition | difficult | to | be | disclosed | by | interested | agents | Alternatively | sector | experts | and | key | informants | could | be | approached | to | provide | their | best | guess | on | the | cost | structure | of | the | most | common | frauds | perpetrated | in | the | wine | value | chain | 12 | This | is | the | procedure | adopted | in | this | study

Formally | the | impact | assessment | can | be | summarized | as | follows | Let | A | f | be | the | m | n | matrix | of | input | coefficients | of | non | compliant | i.e. | fraudulent | production | activities | The | n | 1 | vector | f | of | total | output | of | production | activities | is | given | by | the | sum | of | the | f | f | vector | of | non | compliant | production | total | values | and | the | f | r | vector | of | compliant | i.e. | regular | total | output | values | The | use | matrix | Z | f | representing | total | intermediate | consumptions | commodity | by | industry | use | matrix | for | non | compliant | production | activities | is | computed | via | post | multiplication | of | diagonalized | vector | f | f | to | the | matrix | A | f

The | use | matrix | for | fully | compliant | production | activities | can | be | obtained | by | the | difference

where | Z | is | the | use | matrix | in | the | original | i.e. | actual | SAM | A | matrix | A | r | representing | the | expenditure | coefficients | for | a | production | system | including | only | fully | compliant | production | activities | can | be | estimated | dividing | the | elements | of | Z | r | by | the | total | value | of | regular | products

Matrix | B | representing | the | fully | compliant | i.e. | counterfactual | economy | is | obtained | substituting | the | modified | matrix | A | r | for | the | corresponding | sub | matrix | of | direct | input | coefficients | of | production | activities | included | in | matrix | B | as | resulting | from | the | original | SAM | i.e. | based | on | actual | data

Modelling | the | impact | of | wine | fraud | requires | a | SAM | of | the | Italian | economy | appropriately | disaggregated | to | single | out | the | wine | value | chain | as | well | as | other | relevant | sector | of | the | agri | food | system | The | input | output | I | O | Therefore | the | agricultural | sector | was | disaggregated | to | represent | 8 | different | farming | typologies | according | to | the | classification | adopted | at | the | European | level | within | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | EU | Regulation | 2003/369 | including | the | group | of | farms | specialized | in | permanent | crops | such | as | vineyards | The | account | representing | the | Food | Industry | was | disaggregated | into | 10 | different | of | food | processing | activities | including | wine | making | producing | the | corresponding | 10 | commodities | including | wine | 13 | The | disaggregation | is | fully | consistent | with | the | accounting | rules | defined | within | the | European | System | of | Accounts | Eurostat | 2008 | After | the | disaggregation | the | input | output | table | included | 80 | industries | producing | the | corresponding | 80 | products | 14 | We | then | merged | the | disaggregated | I | O | supply | and | use | tables | with | the | SAM | of | the | Italian | economy | estimated | by | the | Tuscany | Regional | Institute | for | Economic | Planning | with | reference | to | the | same | year | IRPET | 2016 | In | fact | the | original | IRPET | 's | SAM | included | a | supply | and | use | table | based | on | the | ISTAT | 2009 | table | The | classification | of | industries | and | commodities | in | the | IRPET | table | was | fully | consistent | with | that | of | the | ISTAT | table | though | more | aggregated | 37 | industries | producing | 54 | commodities | Therefore | the | inclusion | of | the | disaggregated | supply | and | use | table | in | the | IRPET | 's | SAM | was | quite | straightforward | Accounts | for | the | other | industries | and | commodities | were | reaggregated | where | necessary | to | harmonize | with | the | classification | adopted | in | the | IRPET | matrix | The | new | accounts | for | agriculture | and | food | industry | sub | sectors | were | balanced | adjusting | the | value | of | depreciation | in | the | disaggregation | of | value | added | while | the | accounts | for | new | food | commodities | were | balanced | adjusting | variations | in | stocks | In | the | IRPET | SAM | institutions | purchase | bundles | of | goods | and | services | corresponding | to | 23 | final | consumption | functions | Agriculture | and | food | subsectors | sell | their | products | to | consumers | throughout | two | functions | purchases | of | food | and | purchases | of | beverages | Therefore | the | disaggregation | of | final | consumption | according | to | the | new | classification | of | commodities | in | the | supply | and | use | table | was | not | necessary

Eventually | the | final | SAM | breakdown | includes | the | following | 183 | accounts

-64 | commodities | -54 | industries | -12 | accounts | for | primary | income | distribution | -23 | final | consumptions | functions | -18 | accounts | for | current | income | use | by | institutions | including | 10 | household | groups | according | to | deciles | of | equivalent | per | capita | available | income | and | 8 | Government | accounts | -9 | accounts | to | represent | capital | formation | and | -3 | accounts | for | flows | with | the | rest | of | the | world

An | estimate | of | the | monetary | value | of | seized | and | irregular | products | is | required | to | assess | the | impact | of | wine | frauds | on | the | Italian | economy | through | SAM | simulations | Specifically | an | estimate | of | the | monetary | value | of | fraudulent | wine | at | final | consumption | is | needed | as | simulations | are | modeled | as | exogenous | shocks | on | the | final | demand | cf | Sect | 4.1 | Therefore | food | fraud | data | need | to | be | transformed | as | if | they | referred | to | products | for | final | consumption | using | proper | technical | coefficients | to | convert | the | fraudulent | quantities | detected | at | specific | stages | of | the | value | chain | in | final | consumption | quantity | equivalents | For | example | if | wine | grapes | are | spotted | as | irregular | the | quantity | of | grapes | needs | to | be | transformed | into | wine | equivalent | quantities | using | the | technical | conversion | coefficients | Then | the | resulting | quantities | are | multiplied | by | the | consumer | price | of | wine | in | order | to | get | an | estimate | of | the | monetary | value | of | irregular | wine | at | final | consumption

ICQRF | data | shows | there | are | three | types | of | irregular | seized | products | grapes | musts | and | wines | We | refer | to | technical | data | from | the | literature | Ribéreau | Gayonet | et | al | 2017 | as | well | as | Italian | experts | judgments | to | retrieve | realistic | technical | coefficients | of | conversion | to | transform | the | intermediate | product | quantities | into | final | product | equivalents | as | follows | grapes | to | must | 0.70 | kg | l | must | to | wine | 0.88 | and | grapes | to | wine | 0.616 | kg | l.

In | order | to | estimate | an | average | representative | price | at | final | consumption | we | use | the | ICQRF | dataset | ICQRF | 2016 | that | includes | detailed | information | on | quantities | and | values | of | seized | products | at | various | levels | of | the | value | chain | The | price | is | calculated | as | a | weighted | average | of | the | quantities | seized | from | production | units | that | sell | directly | to | consumers | However | since | seizures | have | been | enforced | in | different | years | we | deflate | their | values | using | the | consumer | price | index | with | the | base | year | 2009 | ISTAT | 2016 | that | is | the | reference | year | of | our | SAM | The | resulting | average | price | to | final | consumption | is | 2.02 | euro | per | liter | of | wine | expressed | in | euro | 2009

In | order | to | make | SAM | simulations | we | need | both | value | of | seized | and | irregular | wine | which | represent | a | lower | and | upper | bound | of | frauds | respectively | However | while | in | the | case | of | seized | products | the | ICQRF | database | reports | both | quantities | and | values | in | the | case | of | irregular | products | the | database | reports | only | quantities | Therefore | the | estimation | procedures | to | compute | the | final | consumption | equivalents | of | the | two | figures | are | different | In | the | case | of | seized | product | in | order | to | get | a | monetary | estimate | it | is | good | enough | to | multiply | the | quantity | equivalent | at | final | consumption | of | seized | musts | and | grapes | as | well | as | wines | times | the | average | consumer | price | of | wine | this | will | yield | the | sample | level | estimates | of | the | yearly | average | seizures | In | the | case | of | irregular | products | we | adopt | a | two | step | procedure | first | we | calculate | the | ratios | of | the | number | of | seized | products | to | the | irregular | products | from | the | ICQRF | database | which | averaged | at | 17.8 | over | the | entire | period | of | 2007 | 2015 | for | wine | value | chain | and | then | we | divide | the | value | of | seized | products | by | this | rate | to | yield | the | value | of | irregular | products | at | the | sample | level | 15 | The | last | step | before | getting | the | figures | to | be | used | in | the | SAM | simulations | is | to | expand | these | sample | level | estimates | to | the | population | level | In | doing | this | we | use | the | ratio | of | the | inspected | establishments | sample | to | the | number | of | active | establishment | population | as | they | result | from | the | last | Census | on | industry | commerce | and | services | ISTAT | 2014 | 16 | The | resulting | sampling | ratio | is | 8.3 | On | average | if | all | establishments | were | inspected | and | if | all | assumptions | above | would | hold | the | value | of | seizures | expanded | to | the | national | population | would | be | 470.7 | million | euro | while | the | value | of | irregular | products | would | be | 3,115.6 | million | euro | both | values | expressed | in | euro | 2009

In | SAM | simulations | we | use | these | two | estimates | as | lower | and | upper | bounds | of | frauds | in | the | wine | supply | chain | respectively

According | to | the | social | accounting | matrix | in | 2009 | the | domestic | food | supply | chain | produced | wine | for | a | total | value | of | 11.3 | billion | euro | Wine | was | supplied | by | production | activities | of | different | size | and | nature | that | could | be | classified | into | different | industries | within | the | SAM | The | total | value | of | output | is | shared | between | production | activities | classified | under | agriculture | 47%)-mostly | small | medium | specialized | permanent | crop | farms | carrying | out | the | whole | production | process | from | the | vineyard | to | the | marketing | of | bottled | wine | 43 | and | other | farms | 4%)-and | the | wine | industry | 50 | Other | manufacturing | and | service | activities | including | the | other | sectors | of | food | industry | account | for | a | tiny | share | of | total | output | about | 3

The | average | annual | values | of | seized | and | irregular | wine | have | been | allocated | among | the | different | activities | producing | wine | in | the | SAM | according | to | their | own | shares | in | total | production | of | wine | The | resulting | vectors | have | been | used | as | exogenous | shocks | in | the | SAM | model | to | estimate | the | share | of | the | Italian | economy | activated | by | the | final | demand | for | seized | and | irregular | wine | products | The | estimated | figures | are | not | trivial | Even | in | the | more | conservative | estimate | i.e. | considering | only | seizures | the |  | fraudulent | wine | activities | generate | over | 17 | thousand | labor | units | Assuming | that | all | irregular | products | were | demanded | by | consumers | the | share | of | total | economy | activated | by | irregular | wine | production | would | represent | 0.31 | of | total | output | and | almost | 0.5 | of | total | employment | that | is | almost | 115 | thousand | full | time | labor | units | Table | 2

The | estimates | are | far | more | impressive | when | looking | at | the | agri | food | system | breakdown | Table | 3 | Up | to | 11.5 | of | the | output | of | specialized | permanent | crop | farms | and | over | 25 | of | wine | industry | would | directly | and/or | indirectly | depend | on | the | final | demand | for | irregular | product | Should | a | food | scandal | scare | determine | a | drop | in | consumers | demand | the | negative | effect | on | production | activities | of | these | sectors | may | be | large | This | is | extremely | important | for | the | Italian | wine | sector | a | value | chain | where | quality | differentiation | through | immaterial | attribute | primarily | geographical | origin | of | products | is | at | the | core | of | its | competitive | advantages | within | the | global | markets | The | potential | negative | impact | is | substantial | both | within | and | outside | the | wine | sector

In | order | to | build | a | counterfactual | SAM | representing | a | hypothetical | fully | compliant | wine | sector | we | estimated | the | A | f | matrix | cf | Sect | 4.2 | using | information | provided | by | a | panel | of | 15 | key | informants | who | are | experts | in | the | wine | value | chain | organization | across | the | country | playing | leading | roles | within | control | bodies | ICQRF | and | the | Agro | food | Unit | of | the | Italian | Forest | Service | research | institutions | Council | for | Agricultural | Research | and | Analysis | of | Agricultural | Economics | producers | associations | wine | consortia | and | freelance | professionals | specialized | in | the | wine | industry | The | key | informants | were | asked | to | provide | information | aiming | at | i | modifying | the | wine | average | cost | structures | as | reported | in | the | original | SAM | i.e. | the | cost | structure | including | both | regular | and | irregular | wine | production | activities | to | better | represent | the | activities | of | different | production | units | and | ii | identifying | the | vector | of | costs | representing | the | cost | structure | of | an | average | non | compliant | production | unit | according | to | the | most | common | frauds | in | the | wine | value | chain | 17 | Table | 4 | reports | the | results | of | this | exercise | including | the | vector | of | direct | expenditure | coefficients | for | the | wine | industry | as | in | the | original | SAM | first | column | and | those | of | the | two | most | common | frauds | last | two | columns | namely | wine | produced | adopting | irregular | wine | making | practices | such | as | the | use | of | wood | chips | to | provide | flavors | to | young | wine | and | commercialization | practices | not | complying | with | administrative | rules | on | process | documentation | and | quality | certification

We | assume | these | coefficients | are | representative | of | the | average | structure | of | costs | in | wine | production | irrespective | of | the | winery | type | e.g. | farm | wineries | vs. | industrial | 17 | The | elicitation | of | expert | estimates | entails | the | following | steps | a | qualitatively | describe | the | most | frequent | frauds | in | the | production | of | wine | b | modify | the | wine | average | cost | structures | i.e. | the | SAM | cost | structures | to | better | represent | the | production | activities | of | different | production | units | c | further | modify | the | vector | of | costs | to | better | represent | cost | structure | of | an | average | non | compliant | production | unit | The | expert | estimates | were | averaged | and | the | resulting | vectors | were | sent | them | back | for | a | double | check | before | being | used | in | building | the | counterfactual | scenario | A | sensitivity | analysis | was | carried | out | replicating | the | counterfactual | analysis | according | to | different | hypotheses | on | the | structure | of | costs | in | irregular | activities | respectively | halving | best | case | and | doubling | worst | case | the | output | to | intermediate | costs | ratio | relative | to | the | reference | estimate | based | on | the | expert | estimates | yielding | a | modest | variation | in | the | estimated | impact | cf | Rocchi | et | al | 2020 |  | for | further | details | and | cooperative | wineries | This | assumption | seems | reasonable | for | two | reasons | First | in | the | disaggregation | of | production | accounts | to | build | the | SAM | Rocchi | et | al | 2020 | each | production | unit | is | classified | under | a | given | industry | according | to | a | prevalence | criterion | in | production | 18 | Second | wine | processing | like | other | bio | based | activities | carried | out | at | the | farm | level | is | a | process | with | limited | economies | of | scale | Even | though | the | production | units | belonging | to | the | wine | industry | account | i.e. | industrial | and | coop | wineries | are | likely | larger | than | those | belonging | to | the | specialized | permanent | crops | account | i.e. | farm | wineries | we | can | assume | that | the | production | cost | structure | is | similar | in | both | cases

According | to | the | experts | most | wine | frauds | are | a | combination | of | adopting | irregular | wine | making | practices | and | not | complying | with | administrative | rules | Therefore | in | calculating | the | matrix | of | multipliers | for | the | counterfactual | fraud | free | wine | sector | we | assumed | a | cost | structure | of | fraudulent | activities | equal | to | the | average | of | the | last | two | columns | in | Table | 4

The | aggregate | economic | impacts | of | frauds | in | the | wine | value | chain | are | summarized | in | Table | 5 | The | level | of | activation | of | the | economy | decreases | irrespective | to | the | size | frauds | i.e. | assuming | the | value | of | the | seized | products | only | or | the | value | of | all | irregular | products | The | loss | of | total | output | in | the | Italian | economy | due | to | wine | frauds | ranges | between | 11 | and | 406 | million | euro | causing | an | employment | loss | up | to | 6 | thousand | labor | units | The | results | show | an | added | value | increase | between | 2 | and | 6 | million | euro | along | with | an | overall | decrease | in | the | economic | activity | level | losses | in | output | and | employment | Such | a | result | represents | a | situation | where | frauds | give | raise | to | rents | decreasing | economic | growth | the | extra | profits | from | frauds | are | likely | to | not | activate | the | circular | flow | as | savings | and | incomes | leak | out | towards | exogenous | accounts | such | as | the | public | administration | and | the | rest | of | the | world | The | potential | loss | in | households | income | ranges | between | 9 | and | 119 | million | euro

The | magnitude | of | impacts | on | agriculture | and | the | food | industry | is | larger | than | on | the | rest | of | the | economy | The | agricultural | output | shrinks | because | of | wine | frauds | up | to | 0.51 | while | the | output | of | the | food | industry | would | be | reduced | by | 0.13 | when | considering | irregular | productions | Table | 6 | The | impacts | are | differentiated | among | production | activities | within | the | agro | food | system | ranging | from | 0.05 | of | output | in | the | meat | industry | to | 0.69 | in | the | wine | industry | estimates | based | on | total | irregular | production | Due | to | the | strong | linkages | between | vineyard | cultivation | and | wine | production | the | impact | on | specialized | permanent | crop | farms | is | significant | 0.54 | of | their | potential | output

The | largest | loss | of | employment | in | absolute | terms | is | recorded | in | agriculture | exceeding | 6 | thousand | labor | units | in | the | upper | bound | estimate | 45 | of | which | in | the | specialized | permanent | crop | farms | Interestingly | the | total | employment | loss | in | the | agri | food | system | only | is | higher | than | the | impact | on | employment | in | the | whole | economy | 5723 | full | time | labor | units | cf | Table | 5 | This | implies | that | the | net | effect | on | employment | in | the | non | food | economy | is | positive | Among | sectors | that | benefit | most | from | frauds | are | professional | scientific | and | technical | activities | including | legal | and | administrative | services | This | is | a | further | element | characterizing | the | rent | effect | generated | by | wine | frauds

Figure | 5 | shows | the | impact | on | household | income | distribution | assuming | a | value | of | frauds | equal | to | that | of | irregular | products | The | overall | distribution | of | impacts | is | not | regressive | showing | positive | impacts | in | the | three | lowest | deciles | and | increasing | negative | impacts | from | the | fourth | decile | upward | However | the | relationship | between | frauds | and | income | distribution | is | not | linear | with | the | top | decile | of | households | showing | a | negligible | negative | effect | It | is | difficult | to | venture | possible | explanations | for | this | pattern | In | a | SAM | model | the | distribution | of | impacts | on | household | incomes | basically | depends | on | the | distribution | of | value | added | to | production | factor | and | on | the | structure | of | earnings | of | each | family | group | 19 | Overall | due | to | the | difference | in | income | levels | between | the | two | odds | of | distribution | the | impact | on | inequality | is | likely | to | be | small

The | contribution | of | this | study | to | the | scanty | literature | on | the | assessment | of | the | economic | impact | of | food | frauds | is | twofold | From | the | methodological | viewpoint | this | paper | proposes | an | approach | to | assess | economy | wide | impacts | adopting | a | SAM | analytical | framework | Building | a | suitable | disaggregated | SAM | makes | possible | to | assess | the | share | of | the | economy | depending | on | the | final | demand | supplied | by | irregular | activities | as | well | as | to | estimate | the | impact | of | wine | fraud | on | the | economy | in | a | counterfactual | framework | From | the | empirical | viewpoint | our | results | show | that | the | share | of | the | Italian | economy | 19 | Frauds | modify | the | distribution | of | incomes | among | production | factors | employed | and | self | employed | labor | capital | and | as | a | result | affect | the | earnings | of | each | family | group | according | to | the | composition | of | their | incomes | On | one | hand | the | fraudulent | wine | production | activities | show | a | larger | share | of | value | added | accruing | to | capital | likely | to | directly | improve | the | relative | position | of | higher | deciles | in | income | distribution | On | the | other | hand | the | induced | impact | of | the | distribution | of | income | of | fraudulent | activities | through | final | consumption | is | likely | to | relatively | increase | the | demand | for | products | produced | by | industries | mainly | nonagricultural | sectors | distributing | a | higher | share | of | value | added | to | employed | labor | so | improving | the | position | of | lower | deciles | in | income | distribution | The | combined | effect | via | direct | indirect | and | induced | impacts | results | in | the | observed | structure | of | impacts | on | households | incomes | that | depends | on | the | final | demand | for | wine | supplied | by | fraudulent | production | activities | is | not | trivial | Wine | frauds | generate | 0.5 | of | total | employment | and | account | for | 0.31 | of | total | output | of | the | Italian | economy | These | estimates | are | much | larger | when | looking | at | impact | on | the | agri | food | system | up | to | 11.5 | of | the | output | of | specialized | permanent | crop | farms | and | up | to | 25 | of | wine | industry | output | may | directly | and/or | indirectly | depend | on | the | final | demand | for | irregular | product

We | can | interpret | the | heavy | dependence | of | wine | demand | on | irregular | productions | as | a | measure | of | the | vulnerability | of | this | sector | to | demand | disruption | should | a | scandal | happen | This | is | of | paramount | importance | for | the | Italian | wine | value | chain | where | quality | differentiation | through | immaterial | attributes | primarily | geographical | origin | is | the | cornerstone | of | its | competitive | advantages | in | the | markets | Paradoxically | it | is | the | attempt | to | vertically | differentiate | wines | that | makes | this | value | chain | more | vulnerable | to | the | risk | of | fraud | as | fraudsters | can | exploit | the | complexity | of | implemented | quality | assurance | systems | A | direct | policy | implication | would | be | simplifying | administrative | procedures | required | for | quality | differentiation | and | designing | more | effective | and | efficient | controls | as | key | components | a | food | safety | and | quality | assurance | system | However | this | might | not | be | an | easy | task | because | as | shown | by | Anania | and | Nisticò | 2004 | the | political | economy | of | regulations | for | credence | goods | allows | for | a | converging | interest | by | the | producers | of | high | quality | goods | and | producers | of | low | quality | goods | in | producing | a | political | compromise | that | results | in | a | regulation | of | little | credibility | and | low | effectiveness | 20 | The | SAM | based | counterfactual | analysis | of | the | impact | of | wine | frauds | on | the | Italian | economy | shows | that | the | loss | of | total | output | can | be | as | high | as | 406 | million | euro | per | year | 2009 | value | considering | the | total | value | of | irregular | products | Significantly | the | results | show | a | slightly | positive | increase | of | value | added | along | with | a | contraction | of | the | activity | level | losses | in | output | and | employment | We | interpret | such | a | result | as | the | presence | of | fraud | rents | the | extra | profits | from | frauds | do | not | activate | the | national | economy | as | they | partially | leak | out | towards | exogenous | accounts | such | as | the | public | administration | and | the | rest | of | the | world | In | terms | of | employment | frauds | in | the | value | chain | imply | a | loss | of | more | 6.8 | thousand | labor | units | mostly | in | the | agriculture | sector | Interestingly | the | employment | loss | in | the | agri | food | systems | is | larger | than | the | employment | loss | in | the | whole | economy | This | implies | that | the | net | effect | on | employment | in | non | agricultural | production | sectors | is | positive | as | it | is | specifically | the | case | for | legal | and | administrative | services | This | is | an | evidence | that | frauds | other | than | wine | sophistication | are | mostly | paper | frauds | due | to | non | compliance | with | production | codes | incorrect | DOP | IGP | labeling | incorrect | administrative | rules | on | process | documentation | and | quality | certification | etc | We | argue | this | as | a | further | element | supporting | the | rent | seeking | nature | of | most | wine | frauds

The | overall | conclusion | emerging | from | the | counterfactual | analysis | is | that | frauds | in | the | wine | value | chain | are | not | only | a | source | of | unfair | competition | to | regular | production | activities | but | also | have | an | overall | contractionary | impact | on | the | whole | economy | due | to | their | character | of | directly | unproductive | rent | seeking | activities | Krueger | 1974 |  | Bhagwati | 1982 | The | policy | implication | is | that | more | effective | tools | to | combat | food | frauds | are | not | only | measures | to | increase | the | wine | sector | competitiveness | in | the | global | markets | but | they | are | also | effective | pro | growth | policies | that | are | likely | to | determine | positive | impacts | on | employment | in | the | short | run

The | value | chain | analysis | shows | that | most | irregularities | 95 | are | made | by | only | three | agents | i.e. | individual | wineries | bottlers | wholesalers | and | retailers | who | also | account | for | almost | all | seizure | value | 99 | Significantly | cooperative | wineries | are | much | less | affected | by | frauds | The | striking | difference | between | individual | and | cooperative | wineries | may | depend | on | lower | fraud | opportunities | of | the | latter | as | compared | to | the | former | or | to | higher | responsiveness | to | fines | and | loss | of | reputation | of | larger | companies | This | evidence | resonates | Parker | 's | 2006 | argument | about | a | more | difficult | compliance | in | small | production | units | because | of | a | combination | of | limited | liability | 21 | and | lower | probability | of | being | detected | by | control | agencies | leading | to | a | deterrence | trap | In | order | to | improve | monitoring | efficiency | ICQRF | may | consider | to | pay | more | attention | to | individual | wineries | especially | those | integrating | different | stages | such | as | wine | processing | bottling | and | distribution | In | fact | production | units | involving | several | stages | of | production | have | a | higher | payoff | in | not | complying | because | the | more | complex | the | production | process | the | more | difficult | to | be | detected | while | expected | gain | from | fraud | increases | since | integrating | various | stages | of | production | the | value | addition | increases

This | study | proves | that | making | an | overall | assessment | of | the | economic | impact | of | frauds | in | a | given | value | chain | can | be | carried | in | a | counterfactual | framework | using | an | appropriately | disaggregated | SAM | However | the | accuracy | of | the | estimates | has | been | limited | by | the | lack | of | data | on | counterfeiting | of | Italian | wine | abroad | i.e. | the | socalled | Italian | sounding | and | the | lack | of | data | on | imported | counterfeited | intermediate | products | While | the | impact | of | the | former | is | likely | to | be | trivial | for | a | product | such | as | wine | the | latter | could | be | of | some | importance | In | both | cases | however | should | data | on | these | illegal | activities | be | available | they | could | be | easily | included | in | the | proposed | framework | through | a | change | in | the | vector | of | the | exogenous | injections
