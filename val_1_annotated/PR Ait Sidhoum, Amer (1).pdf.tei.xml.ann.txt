Firm | level | efficiency | measures | have | important | implications | for | the | assessment | of | their | economic | viability | and | sustainability | The | evaluation | of | a | firm | 's | performance | requires | the | use | of | an | adequate | methodological | approach | to | derive | efficiency | estimates | Given | the | increasing | importance | of | the | environmental | issue | several | conventional | efficiency | analyses | have | been | extended | to | allow | deriving | combined | environmental | and | technical | efficiency | measures | More | recently | some | studies | have | considered | the | role | that | production | risk | can | play | in | assessment | of | the | agricultural | efficiencies

While | the | literature | has | highlighted | that | the | social | sustainability | is | an | issue | of | increasing | concern | to | policymakers | at | national | and | international | levels | And | a | number | of | studies | have | assessed | firm | 's | performance | by | including | the | social | dimension | however | the | impact | of | social | factors | on | the | farms | efficiency | has | not | been | investigated | so | far | Our | thesis | will | make | a | relevant | contribution | to | the | literature | by | assessing | technical | environmental | and | social | efficiency | of | Spanish | farms | Furthermore | in | our | doctoral | project | we | will | consider | the | stochastic | environment | in | which | production | takes | place | while | measuring | efficiencies | State | contingent | techniques | will | be | used | as | the | theoretical | and | empirical | tool | to | allow | for | risk | issues

To | achieve | our | objectives | our | study | will | be | based | on | a | survey | to | collect | the | necessary | data | Information | regarding | economic | environmental | and | social | data | will | be | collected | from | 180 | Catalan | farms | specialized | in | the | production | of | cereal | oilseed | and | protein | COP | crops | Our | research | results | will | be | useful | to | farm | managers | policy | makers | and | society | at | large

During | the | last | century | agricultural | production | has | increased | significantly | and | this | trend | will | continue | Since | according | to | a | study | Tilman | et | al | 2001 | which | extrapolated | into | the | future | in | terms | of | linear | trends | for | the | years | 1960 | 2000 | has | concluded | that | it | will | needs | about | one | billion | hectares | of | land | more | by | 2050 | to | meet | the | increasing | demand | However | if | agriculture | can | be | made | more | efficient | the | amount | of | additional | land | and | other | inputs | required | could | be | much | smaller | The | increase | in | agricultural | and | food | production | has | led | to | social | benefits | but | also | costs | for | farmers | societies | and | the | environment | too | These | negative | consequences | can | no | longer | be | supported

These | adverse | impacts | have | raised | a | lot | of | interest | especially | for | the | environment | where | the | impact | of | intensive | agriculture | can | be | quite | deep | including | emissions | to | air | and | water | the | quality | and | the | quantity | of | water | surface | and | groundwater | soil | erosion | pollution | due | to | the | widespread | use | of | pesticides | and | the | loss | of | biodiversity | and | habitats

In | response | to | these | concerns | governments | and | scientists | have | tried | to | address | these | concerns | the | first | ones | by | policies | aimed | at | the | introduction | of | alternative | forms | of | agriculture | organic | and | a | shift | in | sustainable | agriculture | is | the | case | of | the | recent | reforms | of | the | CAP | which | place | special | emphasis | on | the | quality | of | agricultural | products | and | food | security | McSharry | reform | and | extended | its | political | context | to | meet | the | growing | demands | of | citizens | protect | the | environment | sustainable | agriculture | and | ensure | product | quality | and | food | safety | with | the | Fischler | reforms | in | 2003

On | their | side | the | scientific | community | has | tried | to | assess | the | external | costs | of | this | contemporary | agriculture | but | due | to | the | heterogeneity | of | methods | and | data | it | is | not | easy | to | drive | conclusions | These | costs | mainly | concerns | the | environmental | aspect | in | particular | damage | caused | by | the | application | of | pesticides | where | runoff | of | agricultural | pesticides | from | farm | presents | a | significant | source | of | drinking | water | pollution | and | involves | costs | for | human | health | and | causes | damage | to | wildlife | and | ecosystem | balance | and | biodiversity | Sustainable | agriculture | does | not | depend | only | on | the | economic | and | environmental | aspect | we | should | as | well | consider | the | social | dimension | However | a | feeling | of | oblivion | and | negligence | turns | around | social | sustainability | since | it | is | the | least | developed | compared | to | the | economic | and | environmental | pillars | Kunz | 2006 | Littig | and | Griessler | 2005 | Partridge | 2005 | Cuthill | 2010

Technical | efficiency | is | directly | related | to | the | economic | efficiency | and | traditional | measures | of | efficiency | at | the | firm | level | analyze | the | various | conventional | inputs | and | outputs | and | tend | to | assess | the | ability | of | a | company | to | maximize | its | production | by | fixing | a | set | of | inputs | Farrell | 1957 | Recently | and | due | to | the | growing | interest | for | the | environment | and | in | order | to | improve | the | assessment | of | the | overall | performance | of | the | firms | some | of | them | have | extended | the | approach | of | efficiency | analysis | by | introducing | the | environment | pollution | in | their | assessment | process

It | is | important | to | note | that | many | of | the | studies | that | deal | with | the | evaluation | of | sustainability | define | their | indicators | at | a | global | level | which | can | be | quite | useful | for | politicians | to | make | agricultural | and | environmental | policy | but | are | unhelpful | when | it | comes | to | assessing | unit | management | decisions | And | many | of | those | studies | that | assess | firms | performance | including | the | three | pillars | of | sustainability | but | only | at | an | aggregate | level | however | none | study | has | considered | the | three | pillars | of | sustainability | Economic | Environmental | and | Social | at | the | microeconomic | level | And | none | of | them | has | explicitly | considered | the | role | that | risk | can | play | in | the | assessment | of | the | efficiency | Considering | everything | that | has | been | mentioned | the | following | general | and | specific | objectives | are | proposed

The | main | objective | of | this | project | is | to | assess | combined | environmental | technical | and | social | efficiency | of | Spanish | farms | by | explicitly | allowing | for | the | stochastic | nature | of | production | More | specifically | this | thesis | aims | at | pursuing | the | following | specific | objectives

1

Build | a | data | set | based | on | a | survey | at | the | firm | that | evaluates | farm | level | environmental | technical | and | social | performance | of | Spanish | farms | The | survey | will | collect | technical | environmental | and | social | information | and | will | be | crucial | for | the | achievement | of | our | Ph.D. | thesis | project

Assessing | jointly | the | technical | environmental | and | social | efficiency | of | Spanish | farms | Efficiency | measures | will | be | derived | for | each | farm | in | the | sample | The | interest | to | derive | these | measures | lies | in | the | fact | that | contrary | to | global | sustainability | indicators | they | are | specifically | related | to | farm | management | decisions

On | the | basis | on | efficiency | measurements | make | recommendations | regarding | the | possibility | of | reducing | the | environmental | impact | of | agricultural | activities

Assist | in | the | design | of | economic | proposals | to | reduce | pollution | in | the | agricultural | sector | by | estimating | the | private | cost | of | damage | abatement

Contribute | to | the | still | incipient | literature | on | efficiency | by | explicitly | allowing | for | the | stochastic | conditions | in | which | agricultural | production | takes | place | While | a | number | of | articles | on | the | issue | of | farm | level | efficiency | have | been | published | very | few | of | them | has | allowed | for | the | environmental | impacts | to | depend | on | production | risk | and | none | one | of | them | has | included | the | social | aspect | in | the | assessment | of | efficiency | This | latter | objective | will | involve | extension | of | previously | defined | technical | environmental | and | potentially | social | efficiency | measures | to | allow | for | state | contingent | techniques

In | the | current | situation | of | the | global | economy | where | some | countries | are | going | through | a | rather | difficult | economic | conditions | marked | by | declining | growth | more | unemployment | etc | A | sustainable | economy | is | emerging | as | the | strategic | solution | for | the | sustainable | development | of | the | countries | It | is | in | these | circumstances | that | the | competitiveness | and | efficiency | analysis | of | organizations | should | be | used | as | a | means | to | improve | the | well | being | of | the | societies | This | applies | also | to | the | microeconomic | level

where | efficiency | is | associated | with | the | concept | of | sustainability | where | the | entities | are | trying | to | use | their | economic | resources | in | order | to | maximize | production | and | profit | while | minimizing | costs

The | assessment | of | firms | efficiency | is | a | matter | of | greater | research | not | only | at | the | global | level | even | at | the | microeconomic | level | Its | important | to | note | that | in | the | last | 30 | years | many | studies | have | investigated | this | topic | in | several | fields | The | investigation | behind | inefficient | enterprises | is | essential | to | detect | deficiencies | and | move | toward | a | more | efficient | production

In | light | of | this | problem | literature | suggests | to | use | frontiers | instead | of | traditional | analyzes | that | are | based | on | the | production | functions | A | production | frontier | shows | the | maximum | attainable | output | given | different | input | bundles | and | a | technology | Kumbhakar | and | Lovell | 2000 | Those | firms | operating | on | the | frontier | are | considered | as | technically | efficient | while | those | operating | below | the | frontier | are | labeled | as | inefficient | From | an | economic | perspective | technical | efficiency | as | a | combination | of | input | output | where | it | is | not | possible | to | increase | any | output | decrease | input | without | simultaneously | increasing | the | input | use | or | decreasing | another | output | Koopmans | 1951

Distance | and | Directional | distance | functions | have | become | increasingly | popular | as | a | measure | of | technical | efficiency | that | simultaneously | includes | multiple | outputs | produced | and | multiple | inputs | used | Both | concepts | assess | quantitatively | the | distance | between | the | firm | and | the | efficient | frontier | The | most | common | distance | function | used | is | Shephard | 's | 1970 | input | output | distance | function | which | measures | the | maximum | amount | of | a | firm | input | output | vector | that | can | be | contracted | expanded | by | setting | an | output | input | vector | constant

The | Stochastic | Frontier | Analysis | SFA | is | a | parametric | approach | which | was | originally | and | independently | proposed | by | Aigner | et | al | 1977 | and | Meeusen | and | Van | Den | Broeck | 1977 | as | pointed | out | by | Battese | and | Coelli | 1988 | Efficiency | measurement | in | SFA | is | based | on | the | choice | of | a | specific | parametric | functional | form | for | the | production | frontier | as | well | as | the | specific | distributional | assumptions | of | the | random | noise | and | inefficiency | error | components | SFA | empirical | results | are | quite | sensitive | to | parametric | assumptions | modeling | biases | and | a | possibility | of | incorrect | inferences

In | contrast | to | SFA | Data | Envelopment | Analysis | DEA | techniques | allow | overcoming | many | of | the | SFA | limitations | DEA | was | developed | by | Charnes | et | al | 1978 | based | on | the | work | of | Farrell | 1957 | This | method | has | been | used | to | estimate | the | efficiency | in | the | organizational | units | in | several | areas | Cooper | 1999 | DEA | is | a | nonparametric | method | to | estimate | efficiency | DEA | permits | to | compares | all | firms | to | benchmark | performance | frontier | DEA | does | not | impose | any | assumptions | about | functional | form | characterizing | the | underlying | technology | hence | avoids | misspecification | problems | DEA | does | not | consider | the | statistical | noise | and | the | efficiency | estimates | may | be | biased | if | the | technology | is | largely | characterized | by | stochastic | elements | which | means | that | all | deviations | from | the | frontier | are | assigned | to | inefficiency

On | the | basis | of | the | work | of | Luenberger | 1992 | Chung | et | al | 1997 | defined | the | foundation | to | be | able | to | present | the | joint | production | of | desirable | Good | and | undesirable | bad | outputs | by | extending | the | Shephard | 's | output | distance | function | Shephard | 1970 | to | the | directional | output | distance | function | A | directional | output | distance | function | expands | contracts | good | bad | outputs | along | a | path | that | varies | according | to | the | direction | vector | adopted | Furthermore | the | directional | technology | distance | function | recently | introduced | by | Robert | Chambers | and | his | coauthors | Chambers | et | al | 1996a | Chambers | et | al | 1996b | Chambers | et | al | and | 1998 | completely | generalizes | the | Shephard | 's | input | and | output | distance | functions | providing | an | adequate | tool | to | approach | economic | and | environmental | performance | issues | in | an | integrated | fashion | The | flexibility | of | this | representation | of | the | technology | is | a | remarkable | feature | that | enhances | its | usefulness | in | policy | oriented | applications | Picazo | Tadeo | et | al | 2005

As | the | majority | of | the | economic | activities | the | agricultural | sector | affects | not | only | the | environment | but | also | the | social | life | of | the | farmers | Basically | the | environment | is | affected | by | the | use | of | natural | resources | some | of | which | are | non | renewable | in | order | to | have | good | and | bad | outputs | pollution | A | large | number | of | studies | in | different | regions | and | using | different | methodology | have | tried | to | assess | the | external | costs | environmental | of | agricultural | sector | Pimentel | et | al | 1992 | and | 1995 | Steiner | et | al | 1995 | Fleischer | and | Waibel | 1998 | Bailey | et | al | 1999 | Stoate | et | al | 2001 | Tegtmeier | and | Duffy | 2004 | Pretty | et | al | 2005 | Dale | et | al | 2007 | Praneetvatakul | et | al | 2013 | While | the | assessment | of | the | social | external | costs | of | agriculture | are | quite | rare | because | the | meaning | and | objectives | of | the | social | aspect | within | sustainability | remains | quite | abstract | Dempsey | et | al | 2011 | Casula | Vifell | Soneryd | 2012 | Thin | 2000 | describe | the | social | aspect | as | the | most | conceptually | elusive | pillar | within | sustainability | In | addition | the | social | dimensions | of | sustainability | has | not | drained | the | same | enthusiasm | as | the | other | two | pillars | Cuthill | 2009 | Vavik | Keitsch | 2010 | and | there | is | no | agreement | on | what | issues | should | be | addressed | Dixon | Colantonio | 2008 | Murphy | 2012

Financial | benefits | have | often | been | associated | with | an | increase | in | technical | efficiency | but | what | about | the | effect | of | the | environmental | and | social | efficiency | on | the | firm | 's | performance | Porter | and | Van | Der | Linde | 1995 | emphasize | that | environmental | interests | can | stimulate | innovation | and | efficiency | and | thus | improve | the | competitiveness | of | firms | Which | could | encourage | the | implementation | of | a | cleaner | technologies | the | hypothesis | of | Porter | and | Van | Der | Linde | 1995 | is | supported | by | the | empirical | work | of | Murty | and | Kumar | 2003 | van | der | Vlist | et | al | 2007 | and | Tamini | et | al | 2012 | In | contrast | with | this | hypothesis | Palmer | Oates | and | Portney | 1995 | indicated | that | the | imposition | of | stricter | environmental | regulations | has | no | significant | impact | on | competitiveness

Regarding | the | effect | of | the | social | aspect | on | firm | 's | performance | some | studies | indicate | that | firms | that | invest | in | stakeholder | engagement | and | management | have | a | positive | image | in | the | community | enabling | them | to | recruit | and | retain | high | quality | employees | Lado | and | Wilson | 1994 | Crook | et | al | 2011 | Waddock | Graves | 1997 | Maditinos | etal | 2011 | Cerin | and | Reynisson | 2010 | Humphrey | et | al | 2012 | However | Galema | et | al | 2008 | and | Soana | 2011 | find | no | statistically | significant | link | that | indicates | any | positive | or | negative | relationship | between | Corporate | Social | Performance | and | Corporate | Financial

Performance

The | existing | literature | classifies | the | environmental | efficiency | into | two | groups

the | first | group | consists | of | those | measurements | using | deterministic | methods | while | the | second | group | takes | into | account | the | stochastic | nature | of | the | environment | where | production | takes | place

By | including | pollution | as | an | undesirable | output | Färe | et | al | 1989 | attempted | to | assess | environmental | efficiency | using | conventional | nonparametric | data | envelopment | DEA | methods | The | strong | disposability | is | verified | when | the | undesirable | outputs | heavy | metals | CO | 2 | are | freely | disposable | While | the | weak | disposability | is | verified | when | a | reduction | of | pollution | forces | a | lower | production | of | desirable | outputs | i.e. | the | production | process | is | congested | and | abatement | costs | are | positive | Färe | et | al | 1989 | develop | a | hyperbolic | efficiency | measure | that | considers | both | outputs | asymmetrically | by | expanding | the | desirable | outputs | while | reducing | the | undesirable | outputs | This | enhanced | efficiency | measure | is | compared | with | the | conventional | efficiency | where | setting | the | inputs | constant | one | expands | desirable | outputs | and | ignores | pollution | The | comparison | of | these | two | approaches | shows | that | ignoring | bad | outputs | involves | misrepresentation | of | the | efficiency | magnitude | Using | data | from | U.S. | fossil | fuel | fired | electric | utilities | Färe | et | al | 1996 | decompose | the | overall | factor | productivity | into | a | pollution | index | and | an | input | output | efficiency | index | They | show | that | ignoring | pollution | leads | to | significant | divergence | in | the | rankings | of | the | electric | utilities | Along | the | same | lines | Färe | et | al | 2001 | found | that | ignoring | bad | outputs | leads | to | underestimate | the | annual | productivity | growth | of | US | manufacturing | sectors | for | the | 1974 | 1986 | period | on | average | 1.7 | vs. | 3.6 | A | number | of | studies | has | also | focused | on | the | agricultural | sector | A | literature | review | is | presented | below

Piot | Lepetit | and | Vermersch | 1998 | measure | technical | and | environmental | efficiency | of | the | French | pig | sector | by | considering | organic | nitrogen | pollution | as | weakly | disposable | output | Also | by | using | duality | a | shadow | price | of | nitrogen | pollution | is | derived | Using | DEA | techniques | The | results | indicate | a | limited | ability | to | reduce | nitrogen | pollution | for | given | output | levels

De | Koeijer | et | al | 2002 | present | a | conceptual | model | for | quantifying | sustainability | on | the | basis | of | efficiency | theory | The | conceptual | model | is | implemented | using | DEA | approach | where | pollution | is | considered | as | an | input | Polluting | inputs | are | assumed | to | be | strongly | disposable | which | implies | that | environmental | improvement | can | be | achieved | without | private | costs | Sustainability | is | measured | for | a | sample | of | Dutch | sugar | beet | growers | The | results | show | that | the | average | technical | efficiency | was | only | 50 | which | leads | to | a | considerable | margin | of | progress | of | the | sustainability | and | that | without | new | technology | and | by | avoiding | the | conflict | between | the | economic | and | environmental | objectives | Asmild | and | Hougaard | 2006 | Applying | some | approaches | based | on | the | non | parametric | Data | Envelopment | Analysis | DEA | method | Shortall | et | al | 2013 | analyzed | the | link | between | the | technical | and | environmental | efficiency | of | dairy | farms | in | Scotland | with | regarding | the | greenhouse | gas | emissions | They | find | that | the | bigger | farms | which | are | more | technically | efficient | are | more | efficient | in | their | emissions | of | GHG | emissions

Regarding | the | social | efficiency | and | /or | the | involvement | of | social | factors | in | efficiency | measures | at | the | farm | level | has | not | been | investigated | so | far | Actually | the | requirement | is | more | for | the | development | of | a | better | understanding | of | the | social | aspects | of | sustainability | which | has | received | much | less | interest | than | the | other | two | pillars | of | sustainability | Cuthill | 2009 | Vavik | Keitsch | 2010 | and | to | highlight | the | most | relevant | indicators | for | the | assessment | of | the | social | efficiency

Several | studies | have | aimed | to | develop | social | indicators | at | farm | level | Weber | et | al | 2012 | A | common | characteristic | to | these | analyses | is | that | each | one | has | developed | its | own | indicators | which | depend | on | the | specific | issues | of | the | study | Omann | and | Spangenberg | 2002 | While | a | generalization | is | difficult | to | make | Three | main | types | of | social | sustainability | indicators | can | be | distinguished | First | some | scientists | assess | social | Agricultural | workers | face | numerous | risks | in | the | existing | literature | pesticide | exposure | appears | to | be | the | most | relevant | hazard | While | consumers | deal | more | with | chemical | residues | of | pesticides | agricultural | workers | are | directly | exposed | to | the | pesticide | hazards | during | the | application | Ridley | 2010 | Even | though | some | procedures | have | been | implemented | to | reduce | the | risk | on | farm | workers | health | such | as | the | US | Environmental | Protection | Agency | 's | Worker | Protection | Standard | for | Agricultural

Pesticides | EPA | 1992 | more | studies | are | needed | to | ensure | sustainable | social | development | for | agricultural | workers | Notarnicola | et | al | 2012

In | a | study | that | assesses | the | economic | environmental | and | socio | institutional | aspect | of | the | major | cropping | systems | in | the | North | China | Plain | Zhen | et | al | 2005 | indicated | that | about | 20 | of | farmers | reported | headache | problems | dizziness | nausea | upset | stomach | rash | and | fatigue | caused | in | particular | by | the | use | of | pesticides | This | increases | the | frequency | of | visits | to | the | doctor | during | farming | seasons | relative | to | nonfarming | seasons

California | While | organic | farmers | do | not | suffer | from | the | impact | of | synthetic | pesticides | the | toxicity | related | to | organic | pesticides | should | not | be | ignored |  | the | progress | of | sustainability | They | also | find | that | a | higher | level | of | education | leads | farmers | to | prioritize | the | socio | environmental | outcomes | in | their | agricultural | practices

Regarding | the | involvement | of | social | factors | in | efficiency | measures | Urdiales | et | al | 2015 | constitute | the | unique | exception | Urdiales | et | al | 2015 | used | data | envelopment | analysis | to | assess | the | eco | efficiency | for | a | sample | of | dairy | farms | in | northern | Spain | Noteworthy | that | the | OECD | defined | eco | efficiency | as | the | efficiency | with | which | ecological | resources | are | used | to | meet | human | needs | OECD | 1998 | The | authors | used | information | on | nutrients | balances | and | greenhouse | gas | emissions | to | calculate | environmental | pollution | They | found | that | dairy | farms | are | highly | ecoinefficient | While | some | of | the | results | suggest | that | farmers | that | are | younger | that | plan | to | continue | in | operation | in | the | foreseeable | future | and | that | participate | more | in | training | programs | are | found | to | be | more | eco | efficient

The | literature | review | presented | above | provides | evidence | that | further | research | needs | to | be | done | regarding | the | extension | of | conventional | technical | efficiency | measures | to | a | consideration | of | environmental | issues | and | particularly | social | matters | It | is | also | evident | that | studies | focusing | on | the | efficiency | analysis | of | Spanish | farms | are | very | scarce | which | offers | scope | for | further | research

The | impact | of | the | uncertainty | in | agricultural | production | decisions | has | been | addressed | widely | in | the | literature | in | both | proposing | theoretical | modeling | and | empirical | assessments | and | investigations | As | a | result | of | unpredictable | weather | conditions | pest | infestations | unstable | markets | etc | stochastic | effects | have | been | of | special | interest | in | agriculture | Chavas | and | Holt | 1996 | Moschini | and | Hennessy | 2001 | A | range | of | different | techniques | have | been | developed | to | model | risk | and | risk | preferences | A | priori | probability | assessments | have | usually | served | as | risk | assessment | tools | which | are | known | to | lead | to | potentially | serious | biases | Camerer | 1995 | Risk | preferences | have | been | generally | measured | within | the | expected | utility | model | Saha | et | al | 1994 | which | has | also | been | questioned | as | a | useful | tool | to | adequately | represent | economic | agents | risk | attitudes | see | Rabin | 2000 | Just | and | Peterson | 2003 | Pope | and | Chavas | 1994 | demonstrate | that | cost | minimization | can | not | be | adequately | characterized | by | expected | output | alone | under | risk | aversion | because | the | role | of | risk | management | in | input | use | can | be | relevant | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 1998 | and | 2000 | propose | an | alternative | for | the | modeling | of | preference | selection | under | uncertainty | by | representing | the | stochastic | technology | using | a | state | contingent | input | correspondence | and | they | show | that | under | a | statecontingent | approach | a | standard | cost | minimization | problem | applies | irrespective | of | risk | preferences

The | state | contingent | approach | proposed | by | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 1998 | and | 2000 | and | built | upon | the | theory | developed | by | Debreu | 1959 | and | Arrow | 1965 | is | based | on | the | assumption | that | production | under | uncertainty | can | be | represented | by | differentiating | outputs | and | potentially | inputs | according | to | the | state | of | nature | in | which | they | are | realized | The | advantage | of | this | technique | compared | to | other | methods | is | the | fact | that | it | was | developed | for | a | deterministic | assessment | and | could | be | applied | to | decisionmaking | under | uncertainty | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2000 | show | that | the | duality | methods | of | modern | production | theory | are | fully | applicable | to | state | contingent | production | and | conclude | that | the | state | contingent | approach | provides | the | best | way | to | think | about | all | problems | involving | uncertainty | including | problems | of | consumer | choice | the | theory | of | the | firm | and | principal | agent | relationships | However | empirical | application | of | state | contingent | approach | in | a | production | theory | is | not | obvious | to | perform | as | the | efforts | focus | more | on | the | collection | of | ex | post | production | data | while | the | ex | ante | measures | are | usually | unavailable

This | problem | is | present | in | most | of | the | methods | that | address | modeling | of | stochastic | production | and | is | described | by | O'Donnell | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2010 | as | an | output | cubical | technology | Where | when | the | producers | choose | a | scalar | input | level | along | with | a | stochastic | act | of | nature | determines | output | in | every | state | of | nature

Therefore | the | observation | of | an | output | that | results | from | an | identifiable | state | of | the | nature | is | sufficient | to | determine | the | selected | input | and | output | that | would | have | been | realized | in | any | other | state | of | nature | However | if | the | restrictive | assumption | is | not | satisfied | it | has | been | shown | that | this | technique | potentially | leads | to | important | biases | in | efficiency | estimates | O'Donnell | et | al | 2010 | In | our | work | we | will | apply | the | state | contingent | approach | fairly | easily | since | our | survey | enables | us | to | collect | information | on | ex | ante | state | contingent | outputs

Despite | the | relevance | of | this | technique | in | stochastic | production | modeling | the | state | contingent | technology | has | seen | few | empirical | applications | For | example | Chavas | Farmers | decisions | making | affect | directly | the | efficiency | of | their | farms | but | these | decisions | may | have | an | impact | beyond | the | farm | it | is | for | this | reason | that | governments | may | be | interested | in | what | happens | inside | the | farm | In | addition | to | the | economic | influences | and | the | environmental | interests | literature | has | highlighted | the | importance | of | the | social | dimension | in | the | decisions | making | of | farmers | in | their | agricultural | activities

As | noted | above | except | Urdiales | et | al | 2015 | who | attempted | to | explain | the | score | of | ecoefficiency | according | to | certain | socioeconomic | characteristics | and | some | farmers | attitudes | by | considering | some | Spanish | dairy | farms | However | the | impact | of | the | social | dimension | in | the | agricultural | efficiency | has | not | been | investigated | so | far

In | addition | to | the | measurement | of | technical | and | environmental | efficiency | in | a | statecontingent | framework | this | work | will | assess | the | social | efficiency | by | considering | several | social | factors | socio | demographic | characteristic | of | the | farmers | farmers | perceptions | of | the | impact | of | farming | activities | on | their | mental | and | physical | health | structure | of | the | farm | business | and | social | externalities | of | agricultural | activities

Ignoring | the | effect | of | uncertainty | in | the | agricultural | sector | may | lead | to | biased | estimates | of | efficiency | e.g. | Chen | and | Van | Dalen | 2010 | to | avoid | this | recently | the | traditional | measures | of | efficiency | have | integrated | stochastic | effect | in | the | assessment | of | the | agricultural | efficiency

As | already | indicated | above | our | work | consists | in | the | assessment | of | technical | environmental | and | social | efficiency | using | State | contingent | approach | by | allowing | the | effect | of | uncertainty | in | the | production | following | the | works | of | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 1996 | 1997 | and | 2000

Consider | a | firm | that | uses | a | vector | of | inputs | 𝒙 | 𝑥 | 1 | 𝑥 | 𝑛 | ℝ | 𝑁 | to | produce | an | 𝑦

output | Uncertainty | is | represented | by | a | set | of | states | of | nature | Ω | 1,2 | 𝑆 | hence | there | exists | a | state | contingent | output | set | that | gives | the | range | of | output | values | once | 𝒙 | 𝑥 | 1 | 𝑥 | 𝑛 | ℝ | 𝑁 | is | committed | By | considering | the | state | contingent | framework | production | activities | thus | take | place | over | two | periods | of | time | in | period | 0 | the | producer | chooses | the | quantity | of | non | stochastic | input | to | use | in | period | 1 | Nature | chooses | a | particular | state | of | Nature | that | determines | the | realized | output | If | Nature | picks | a | state | 𝑆 | then | the | realized | output | can | be | denoted | by | 𝑦 | 𝑠 | The | state | contingent | framework | is | flexible | in | that | it | allows | for | perfect | substitution | between | stochastic | outputs | no | substitution | and | intermediate | substitution | possibilities

The | feasible | production | set | under | the | state | contingent | approach | 𝑇 | can | be | derived | as | follows

where | 𝑦 | 𝑦 | 1 | 𝑦 | 𝑠 | ℝ | 𝑆 | is | a | vector | of | state | contingent | output | levels | 𝑦 | 𝑠 | being | the | quantity | of | output | realized | under | the | sth | state | of | nature | 𝑇 | is | interpreted | as | an | ex | ante | technology

Increasing | the | output | vector | size | under | the | state | contingent | framework | may | indicate | problems | of | dimensionality | which | is | especially | relevant | for | the | SFA | approach | in | addition | to | this | the | number | of | parameters | to | estimate | increases | substantially | Further | as | shown | by | Chavas | 2008 | the | use | of | state | contingent | techniques | jointly | with | parametric | efficiency | estimation | methods | can | be | problematic | as | ex | ante | state | contingent | outputs | tend | to | be | highly | correlated | with | each | other | which | leads | to | potential | multicollinearity | issues | that | become | particularly | relevant | in | econometric | model | estimation | when | the | number | of | state | dependent | variables | is | larger | than | 2

In | contrast | to | SFA | Data | Envelopment | Analysis | DEA | techniques | which | allows | for | efficiency | measurement | of | multiple | inputs | and | outputs | without | assigning | weights | and | specifying | any | function | form | which | reduces | the | risk | of | misspecification | issues | that | may | lead | to | biased | efficiency | estimates

Following | Färe | et | al | 1994 | the | DEA | linear | programming | model | to | assess | inputoriented | version | can | be | expressed | as

Where | 𝑁 | represents | the | number | of | farms | The | constraint | 𝑁1 | 𝜆 | 1 | is | included | to | allow | for | variable | returns | to | scale

Our | analysis | will | be | based | on | cross | sectional | farm | level | data | collected | from | a | sample | of | 180 | Spanish | holdings | specialized | in | the | production | of | cereal | oilseed | and | protein | COP | crops | As | will | be | explained | with | more | detail | below | the | analysis | will | focus | on | the | COP | sector | given | the | important | use | that | this | sector | makes | of | Spanish | arable | land

The | information | will | be | collected | in | two | stages | first | we | will | collect | detailed | information | from | each | farm | on | planned | input | use | in | addition | to | information | 's | on | physical | structural | economic | environmental | and | social | data | of | the | farms | will | also | be | collected | Special | care | will | be | taken | when | collecting | data | on | ex | ante | outputs | for | three | alternative | states | of | nature | bad | normal | and | ideal | growing | conditions | 𝑦 | 𝑦 | 1 | 𝑦 | 2 | 𝑦 | 3

This | stage | started | during | the | planting | season | Octobre | 2015 | Secondly | ex | post | data | on | production | will | be | collected | during | the | harvesting | season | summer | 2016

Our | analysis | will | focus | on | farms | specialized | in | cereal | oilseed | and | protein | COP | crops | COP | crops | that | are | mainly | devoted | to | human | consumption | and | animal | feed | can | be | cultivated | on | the | same | type | of | land | and | require | similar | equipment | In | the | year | 2013 | the | COP | sector | with | a | production | value | of | nearly | 5 | billion | euros | which | represents | almost | 20 | of | the | total | vegetable | production | in | Spain | Spanish | Ministry | of | Agriculture | Food | and | Environment | magrama | 2014

The | cop | sector | represents | more | than | 120,000 | farm | holdings | which | represents | 13 | of | total | Spanish | agricultural | holdings | INE | 2009 | Our | questionnaire | See | Appendix | 1 | allows | us | to | focus | on | the | estimation | of | nitrogen | pollution | two | main | methods | are | identified | the | farm | gate | balance | and | the | soil | surface | balance | Due | to | the | financial | constraints | of | the | second | approach | in | our | study | we | opt | for | the | farm | gate | balance | which | allow | us | to | consider | the | nutrients | imported | through | inputs | and | the | nutrients | exported | Under | this | method | two | input | sources | are | considered

nitrogen | applied | through | fertilizers | and | seeds | The | nitrogen | output | source | is | cropnitrogen | removal | The | estimation | of | nitrogen | content | will | be | based | on | coefficients | facilitated | by | some | research | conducted | by | the | Spanish | Ministry | of | Agriculture | 2005 | and | Mercadé | Delgado | and | Gil | 2012

The | questionnaire | also | allows | us | focus | on | pesticide | emissions | since | it | includes | very | detailed | questions | on | the | application | of | herbicides | fungicides | and | insecticides | including | the | chemical | formula | and | the | applied | doses | This | allows | us | to | estimate | of | the | quantity | of | the | active | substance | used | during | the | phytosanitary | application | Since | the | different | active | ingredients | do | not | have | the | same | environmental | effects | a | weighting | procedure | based | on | Acceptable | Daily | Intake | ADI | will | be | used | to | approximate | contamination | caused | by | pesticides

The | last | part | of | the | questionnaire | will | allow | us | to | examine | the | social | dimension | within | the | farm | in | addition | to | the | farmers | socio | economic | factors | the | questionnaire | also | includes | working | hours | per | year | the | number | of | vacation | days | and | the | number | of | accidents | linked | to | agricultural | activities | The | survey | will | also | allow | us | to | investigate | the | perception | of | farmers | who | will | judge | forty | statements | on | a | Likert | scale | of | 4 | These | statements | are | related | to | working | conditions | in | the | farm | the | impact | of | faming | activities | on | the | farmers | health | and | social | externalities | associated | with | farming | activities

Since | our | research | will | be | based | upon | survey | data | the | first | results | will | not | be | obtained | until | the | second | half | of | the | second | year | where | a | descriptive | analysis | of | collected | data | will | be | elaborated | The | most | relevant | results | however | will | not | be | obtained | until | the | third | year

Regarding | scientific | paper | production | we | expect | to | elaborate | three | articles

First | scientific | paper | This | paper | will | focus | on | assessing | the | difference | between | efficiency | measures | derived | by | using | conventional | efficiency | DEA | analyses | and | the | implementation | of | DEA | techniques | within | a | state | contingent | framework

Second | scientific | paper | This | paper | will | be | elaborated | in | parallel | with | the | first | one | and | its | aim | will | be | to | compare | the | efficiency | estimators | derived | through | the | stochastic | frontier | analysis | with | or | without | the | use | of | state | contingent | techniques

Third | scientific | paper | This | paper | will | focus | on | the | derivation | of | the | combined | technical | environmental | and | social | efficiency | measures | for | the | sample | farms

We | expect | that | with | this | thesis | we | will | make | the | following | contributions

Contributions | to | the | development | of | the | efficiency | measures | at | farm | level | which | has | not | received | much | attention

Development | of | social | sustainability | indicators | at | the | farm | level
