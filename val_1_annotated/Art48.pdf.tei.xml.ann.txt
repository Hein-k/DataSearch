This | study | aims | at | assessing | the | efficiency | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | and | at | observing | changes | in | this | efficiency | over | a | period | of | time | In | order | to | achieve | this | aim | three | groups | of | indicators | namely | resource | input | and | result | ones | were | used | for | the | analysis | On | the | basis | of | information | available | from | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | these | indicators | were | calculated | for | the | years | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | The | results | of | the | analysis | revealed | that | the | least | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | all | three | groups | of | indicators | were | the | smallest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | As | the | economic | size | of | dairy | farms | increased | the | efficiency | of | dairy | farms | also | increased | and | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | medium | and | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | and | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | However | the | efficiency | of | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | was | already | lower | than | that | of | the | medium | and | larger | ones | and | close | to | the | efficiency | of | the | smallest | dairy | farms

Milk | production | is | one | of | the | most | important | sub | sectors | within | Lithuanian | agriculture | and | for | many | years | it | has | been | ranked | second | after | cereals | production | Nevertheless | the | role | of | milk | production | in | Lithuanian | agriculture | is | declining | in | 2013 | the | share | of | milk | in | the | total | agricultural | production | has | comprised | 19.2 | while | in | 2018 | it | has | made | up | 16.2 | Milk | production | has | decreased | from | 1,723.1 | thousand | tonnes | in | 2013 | to | 1,515.0 | thousand | tonnes | in | 2018 | or | by | 12.1 | while | over | the | same | period | milk | purchase | for | processing | has | slightly | increased | from | 1,339.5 | thousand | tonnes | to | 1,363.0 | thousand | tonnes | or | by | 1.8 | 9 | The | vast | majority | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | are | small | scale | family | dairy | farms | Despite | the | fact | that | the | average | herd | size | in | Lithuania | has | increased | from | 4.8 | cows | per | farm | in | 2013 | to | 6.6 | cows | per | farm | in | 2017 | it | remains | one | of | the | smallest | in | the | EU | only | Romania | has | a | smaller | average | herd | size | than | Lithuania | 7 | In | Lithuania | the | largest | share | of | freshly | milked | raw | milk | about | 80 | is | sold | for | processing | The | smaller | dairy | farms | receive | considerably | lower | prices | for | raw | milk | than | the | larger | ones | Taking | this | into | account | the | smaller | dairy | farms | either | go | out | of | business | or | become | the | larger | ones | In | many | countries | the | number | of | dairy | farms | has | been | decreasing | while | the | size | of | dairy | farms | has | been | increasing | The | question | arises | whether | only | the | larger | dairy | farms | perform | most | efficiently | A | number | of | studies | have | been | carried | out | in | different | countries | in | order | to | analyse | various | aspects | related | to | the | situation | and | development | of | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | such | as | efficiency | 4 | 6 | competitiveness | 10 | value | added | 5 | level | of | saved | up | surplus | for | investment | selffinancing | 3 | unit | cost | 8 | Such | studies | are | lacking | in | Lithuania | therefore | in | order | to | fill | the | gap | this | study | has | been | carried | out | The | present | study | has | been | aimed | at | assessing | the | efficiency | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | and | at | observing | changes | in | this | efficiency | over | a | period | of | time

First | of | all | in | this | study | the | size | structure | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | over | the | period | 2013 | 2017 | was | examined | In | order | to | achieve | this | data | from | the | State | Enterprise | Agricultural | Information | and | Rural | Business | Centre | was | used | 1 | Secondly | the | efficiency | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | was | assessed | using | three | groups | of | indicators | namely | resource | input | and | result | ones | All | these | indicators | were | calculated | per | livestock | unit | Although | the | dominant | source | of | income | for | dairy | farms | is | milk | production | the | livestock | unit | rather | than | dairy | cow | was | selected | for | the | analysis | since | other | cattle | are | also | involved | in | the | reproduction | process | In | order | to | maintain | these | cattle | resources | are | needed | and | in | addition | these | cattle | generate | certain | income | on | dairy | farms | Resource | indicators | helped | to | assess | the | degree | of | utilisation | of | resources | needed | to | carry | on | and | develop | the | activity | on | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | These | indicators | included | the | following | -Total | utilised | agricultural | area

-Total | labour | input

-Total | fixed | assets

-Renewal | ratio | of | fixed | assets

-Total | current | assets | and | inventories

-Balance | subsidies | and | taxes | on | investments | including | on | agricultural | investments

-Debt | to | assets | ratio | although | this | indicator | is | commonly | used | to | assess | a | farm | activity | risk | but | it | also | shows | the | capacity | of | a | farm | to | attract | external | capital | for | the | development | of | this | farm | Input | indicators | helped | to | assess | which | categories | of | inputs | were | used | most | efficiently | on | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | and | how | these | categories | of | inputs | affected | the | total | inputs | These | indicators | included | the | following | -Total | specific | costs | -Sum | of | balance | current | subsidies | and | taxes | and | total | direct | payments

-Ratio | of | total | output | to | total | input | -Ratio | of | sum | of | total | output | and | balance | current | subsidies | and | taxes | and | total | direct | payments | to | total | input | All | indicators | were | calculated | for | the | years | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | In | these | years | the | conditions | for | the | development | of | dairy | farming | in | Lithuania | differed | significantly | The | year | 2013 | was | exceptionally | good | for | dairy | farming | due | to | a | very | high | worldwide | demand | for | dairy | products | which | lead | to | higher | milk | purchase | prices | In | that | year | milk | purchase | prices | in | Lithuania | reached | their | alltime | highest | level | On | the | contrary | the | year | 2015 | was | unfavourable | for | the | development | of | dairy | farming | The | collapse | in | worldwide | demand | for | dairy | products | and | increased | raw | milk | supply | had | a | negative | impact | on | milk | purchase | prices | In | 2015 | as | compared | to | 2013 | the | average | purchase | price | for | raw | milk | in | Lithuania | dropped | by | 32 | Finally | the | 2017 | year | was | average | for | the | development | of | dairy | farming | and | the | average | purchase | price | for | raw | milk | was | higher | by | 37 | than | in | 2015 | but | lower | by | 8 | than | in | 2013 | 9 | In | order | to | assess | the | efficiency | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | data | from | the | European | Union | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | FADN | was | used | 2 | For | the | year | 2013 | the | FADN | database | provided | data | on | dairy | farms | of | four | different | economic | sizes | while | for | the | years | 2015 | and | 2017 | this | database | provided | data | on | dairy | farms | of | five | different | economic | sizes

Milk | production | in | Lithuania | is | very | fragmented | in | 2017 | there | were | 41,354 | dairy | farms | which | kept | 272.1 | thousand | dairy | cows | Between | 2013 | and | 2017 | the | number | of | dairy | farms | and | the | number | of | dairy | cows | continuously | decreased | Over | this | period | the | number | of | dairy | farms | declined | by | more | than | one | third | 35.8 | and | the | number | of | dairy | cows | dropped | by | more | than | one | tenth | 12.3 | Table | 1 | In | 2017 | in | Lithuania | the | smallest | dairy | farms | those | with | less | than | 10 | dairy | cows | accounted | for | 88.8 | of | the | total | number | of | all | dairy | farms | and | dairy | cows | on | these | dairy | farms | represented | 30.2 | the | total | number | of | dairy | cows | Between | 2013 | and | 2017 | the | number | of | the | smallest | dairy | farms | and | the | number | of | dairy | cows | on | these | dairy | farms | fell | the | most | Over | this | period | only | the | number | of | dairy | farms | with | 50 | and | more | dairy | cows | rose | and | the | number | of | dairy | cows | on | these | dairy | farms | showed | an | increase | as | well | In | 2017 | these | dairy | farms | accounted | for | 1.8 | of | the | total | number | of | all | dairy | farms | and | dairy | cows | on | these | dairy | farms | represented | 40.3 | the | total | number | of | dairy | cows | In | Lithuania | the | structural | changes | in | dairy | farming | were | strong | with | the | number | of | dairy | farms | especially | the | smallest | ones | dropping | significantly | In | order | to | compare | the | performance | and | activity | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | the | FADN | which | provides | data | for | specialised | dairy | farms | from | the | EU | countries | is | useful | Table | 2 | presents | the | classification | of | dairy | farms | by | economic | size | and | the | number | of | livestock | units | on | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | in | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017

Table | 3 | presents | the | resource | indicators | per | livestock | unit | on | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | in | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | The | smallest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | needed | to | accumulate | the | most | resources | per | livestock | unit | therefore | these | dairy | farms | were | the | least | efficient | in | terms | of | resource | utilisation | Compared | to | dairy | farms | which | required | the | least | resources | per | livestock | unit | the | smallest | dairy | farms | needed | around | three | times | more | labour | input | and | ten | times | more | total | fixed | assets | Differences | in | utilisation | of | other | resources | were | smaller | but | also | significant | However | with | regard | to | renewal | ratio | of | fixed | assets | the | smallest | dairy | farms | showed | having | the | potential | the | renewal | ratio | of | fixed | assets | for | these | dairy | farms | was | the | highest | The | effect | of | economies | of | scale | was | most | noticeable | when | considering | total | labour | input | and | total | utilised | agricultural | area | per | livestock | unit | these | indicators | were | the | highest | on | the | largest | dairy | farms | and | the | lowest | on | the | smallest | dairy | farms | On | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | as | compared | to | the | smallest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | the | total | labour | input | per | livestock | unit | was | lower | from | 9 | times | in | 2015 | to | 10 | times | in | 2017 | while | the | utilised | agricultural | area | per | livestock | unit | was | lower | from | 56 | in | 2015 | to | 2 | times | in | 2017 | It | is | to | be | noted | that | in | 2017 | as | compared | to | 2015 | the | disparities | had | increased | The | larger | the | dairy | farm | the | more | efficiently | the | labour | input | and | utilised | agricultural | area | per | livestock | unit | were | used | The | total | fixed | assets | per | livestock | unit | was | used | more | efficiently | on | the | medium | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | thousand | of | standard | production | These | dairy | farms | had | the | least | amount | of | total | fixed | assets | per | livestock | unit | As | the | economic | size | of | dairy | farms | increased | or | decreased | the | needs | for | total | fixed | assets | per | livestock | unit | rose | The | same | situation | was | observed | in | 2013 | and | 2015 | with | regard | to | total | current | assets | and | inventories | per | livestock | unit | However | this | trend | reversed | in | 2017 | when | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | had | the | least | amount | of | total | current | assets | and | inventories | per | livestock | unit | and | as | the | economic | size | of | dairy | farms | decreased | the | needs | for | total | current | assets | and | inventories | per | livestock | unit | rose | The | renewal | ratio | of | fixed | assets | helped | to | assess | whether | the | technical | condition | of | fixed | assets | was | outdated | and | depreciated | and | whether | it | served | as | an | obstacle | for | dairy | farms | to | develop | their | activity | The | value | of | this | indicator | is | to | be | assessed | over | a | period | of | several | years | In | this | study | the | renewal | ratio | of | fixed | assets | was | calculated | as | averages | of | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | values | The | results | showed | that | the | smallest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | had | the | fastest | renewal | of | fixed | assets | the | renewal | ratio | of | fixed | assets | for | these | dairy | farms | was | 0.19 | The | values | of | this | indicator | for | dairy | farms | of | other | economic | sizes | were | smaller | 0.10 | for | dairy | farms | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 8-<25 | and | 25-<50 | thousand | of | standard | production | 0.15 | for | dairy | farms | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | and | 0.14 | for | dairy | farms | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | This | could | simply | be | explained | by | the | fact | that | the | smallest | dairy | farms | received | the | highest | investment | support | per | livestock | unitan | average | of | EUR | 799 | per | the | years | 2015 | and | 2017 | while | the | dairy | farms | of | other | economic | sizes | received | lower | investment | support | per | livestock | unitan | average | of | EUR | 101 | 420 | per | the | years | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | The | larger | and | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | and | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | were | more | capable | to | attract | external | capital | The | values | of | debt | to | assets | ratio | for | these | dairy | farms | in | all | years | were | among | the | highest | and | reached | 15 | 20 | while | the | values | of | debt | to | assets | ratio | for | other | dairy | farms | were | 2 | 13

Table | 4 | presents | the | input | indicators | per | livestock | unit | on | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | in | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | In | 2013 | and | 2015 | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | were | the | medium | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | of | 25-<50 | thousand | of | standard | production | the | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | on | these | dairy | farms | were | lower | by | 17.1 | in | 2013 | and | by | 20.8 | in | 2015 | than | on | dairy | farms | with | the | highest | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | in | the | relevant | year | In | 2017 | the | situation | slightly | changed | and | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | became | the | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | of | standard | production | The | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | on | these | dairy | farms | were | lower | by | 35.0 | than | on | dairy | farms | with | the | highest | total | inputs | in | that | year | In | 2015 | and | 2017 | the | least | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | were | the | smallest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | The | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | on | these | dairy | farms | were | higher | by | 26.2 | in | 2015 | and | by | 53.9 | in | 2017 | than | on | dairy | farms | with | the | lowest | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | in | the | relevant | year | The | second | least | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | were | the | largest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | The | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | on | these | dairy | farms | were | higher | by | 20.6 | in | 2013 | by | 23.4 | in | 2015 | and | by | 29.6 | in | 2017 | than | on | dairy | farms | with | the | lowest | total | inputs | in | the | relevant | year | The | specific | costs | accounted | for | the | largest | share | of | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | on | average | 42 | 50 | but | they | did | not | influence | the | efficiency | of | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | These | costs | were | the | lowest | on | the | smaller | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 8-<25 | thousand | of | standard | production | and | the | highest | on | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | The | most | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | were | those | with | the | lowest | depreciation | however | these | costs | did | not | influence | the | efficiency | of | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | as | well | since | the | depreciation | accounted | only | for | 23 | 28 | of | total | inputs | The | most | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | total | inputs | per | livestock | unit | had | the | low | and | average | levels | of | all | categories | of | inputs

Table | 5 | presents | the | result | indicators | per | livestock | unit | on | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | in | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | For | the | milk | yield | per | dairy | cow | the | highest | was | observed | on | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | while | the | lowest | was | observed | on | the | smallest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | The | difference | in | milk | yield | per | cow | between | the | largest | and | smallest | dairy | farms | widened | in | 2013 | it | stood | at | 28.9 | while | in | 2017 | it | reached | 36.0 | The | highest | output | per | livestock | unit | was | also | observed | on | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | while | the | lowest | was | observed | on | the | smaller | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 8-<25 | thousand | of | standard | production | The | smallest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | had | a | better | output | per | livestock | unit | performance | than | the | smaller | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 8-<25 | thousand | of | standard | production | A | possible | explanation | for | this | could | be | that | the | freshly | milked | raw | milk | at | least | in | some | of | the | smallest | dairy | farms | was | not | sold | for | processing | but | processed | on | these | dairy | farms | Produced | dairy | products | were | sold | directly | to | consumers | and | sales | of | these | higher | value | added | dairy | products | generated | more | income | for | the | smallest | dairy | farms | The | ratio | of | total | output | to | total | input | reflects | the | efficiency | of | dairy | farms | most | accurately | This | indicator | was | not | the | highest | on | the | largest | dairy | farms | having | the | best | output | per | livestock | unit | performance | For | the | ratio | of | total | output | to | total | input | in | 2013 | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | those | having | the | lowest | total | input | and | the | highest | total | output | per | livestock | unit | were | the | medium | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | thousand | of | standard | production | while | in | 2015 | and | 2017 | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | According | to | this | indicator | the | least | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | smaller | and | smallest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 8-<25 | thousand | of | standard | production | in | 2013 | and | 2015 | and | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | in | 2017 | These | dairy | farms | had | the | highest | total | input | and | the | lowest | total | output | per | livestock | unit | and | their | activity | without | support | was | the | least | profitable | in | 2013 | and | had | been | loss | making | in | 2015 | and | 2017 | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | received | uneven | levels | of | support | for | their | activity | The | support | for | the | activity | in | this | case | was | considered | as | the | sum | of | balance | current | subsidies | and | taxes | and | direct | payments | as | both | these | components | affected | income | equally | The | smaller | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 8-<25 | thousand | of | standard | production | received | the | highest | support | per | livestock | unit | As | the | economic | size | of | dairy | farms | increased | the | support | per | livestock | unit | decreased | The | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | received | the | lowest | support | per | livestock | unit | and | this | support | was | by | 41 | 50 | smaller | than | support | received | by | the | smaller | and | smallest | dairy | farms | The | higher | support | for | the | smaller | and | smallest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | and | 8-<25 | of | standard | production | made | their | activity | from | loss | making | to | profitable | For | the | ratio | of | sum | of | total | output | and | all | the | support | to | total | input | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | medium | and | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | thousand | of | standard | production | in | 2013 | and | 2015 | and | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | in | 2017

According | to | this | indicator | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | were | the | least | efficient | in | 2013 | and | 2015 | while | they | were | the | second | least | efficient | in | 2017 | in | that | year | the | least | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | smallest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | Nevertheless | the | activity | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | all | economic | sizes | with | support | was | profitable

In | order | to | comprehensively | assess | the | efficiency | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | three | groups | of | indicators | namely | resource | input | and | result | ones | were | used | for | the | analysis | On | the | basis | of | information | available | from | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | these | indicators | were | calculated | for | the | years | 2013 | 2015 | and | 2017 | to | observe | changes | in | the | efficiency | of | Lithuanian | dairy | farms | of | different | economic | sizes | over | a | period | of | time

The | most | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | resource | indicators | were | the | larger | and | largest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | and | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | The | needs | for | all | resources | on | these | dairy | farms | were | among | the | lowest | The | smallest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | receiving | the | highest | investment | support | per | livestock | unit | had | the | fastest | renewal | of | fixed | assets | The | larger | and | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | and | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | receiving | much | less | investment | support | per | livestock | unit | renewed | fixed | assets | at | only | a | slightly | slower | pace | since | they | were | more | capable | to | attract | external | capital | The | best | efficiency | of | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | input | indicators | was | related | to | the | low | and | average | levels | of | all | categories | of | inputs | In | 2013 | and | 2015 | the | medium | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | thousand | of | standard | production | and | in | 2017 | the | larger | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | had | such | levels | of | all | categories | of | inputs

Assessing | the | result | indicators | it | could | be | noted | that | as | the | economic | size | of | dairy | farms | increased | the | milk | yield | and | total | output | increased | as | well | However | in | order | to | achieve | higher | milk | yield | and | total | output | dairy | farms | of | larger | economic | sizes | needed | higher | input | For | the | ratio | of | total | output | to | total | input | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | medium | and | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | and | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | while | the | least | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | smallest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | Although | as | the | economic | size | of | dairy | farms | increased | the | all | support | per | livestock | unit | decreased | according | to | the | ratio | of | sum | of | total | output | and | all | the | support | to | total | input | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | medium | and | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | and | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | while | the | least | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | smallest | and | largest | ones

The | least | efficient | dairy | farms | in | terms | of | all | three | groups | of | indicators | were | the | smallest | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 2-<8 | thousand | of | standard | production | As | the | economic | size | of | dairy | farms | increased | the | efficiency | of | dairy | farms | also | increased | and | the | most | efficient | dairy | farms | were | the | medium | and | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | and | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | However | the | efficiency | of | the | largest | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 100-<500 | thousand | of | standard | production | was | already | lower | than | that | of | the | medium | and | larger | ones | and | close | to | the | efficiency | of | the | smallest | dairy | farms | In | 2013 | the | medium | dairy | farms | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 25-<50 | thousand | standard | production | were | more | efficient | than | the | larger | ones | those | of | the | economic | size | of | EUR | 50-<100 | thousand | of | standard | production | while | in | 2017 | slightly | more | indicators | showed | that | the | larger | dairy | farms | were | more | efficient | than | the | medium | ones
