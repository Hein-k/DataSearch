Over | the | past | decades | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | has | undergone | remarkable | changes | In | the | 1980s | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | was | the | main | pork | product | provider | of | the | Eastern | bloc | but | after | the | political | and | economic | transition | the | sector | lost | its | main | markets | and | the | size | of | pig | herds | decreased | radically | The | economic | changes | have | brought | negative | impacts | for | all | the | players | of | the | pork | supply | chain | the | producers | have | been | mostly | affected | but | slaughterhouses | and | the | processing | industry | had | to | face | new | circumstances | as | well | The | goal | of | this | paper | is | to | review | the | present | situation | and | the | current | problems | of | the | Hungarian | pig | producing | sector | and | to | draw | up | the | main | prospects | and | favourable | directions | of | the | future | by | the | findings | of | the | SWOT | analysis | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | and | based | on | the | proposed | directions | of | the | government | 's | new | pork | strategy | As | the | pig | sector | is | an | important | pillar | of | the | Hungarian | agriculture | and | the | rural | communities | it | is | worth | to | summarize | the | sector | 's | present | market | position | and | to | set | those | opportunities | which | could | give | advantages | for | Hungary | in | the | international | competition | The | paper | concluded | that | the | most | prominent | problems | of | the | pig | sector | are | caused | by | the | economic | and | structural | problems | of | the | sector | based | on | the | problem | tree | and | sector | 's | SWOT | analysis | the | main | external | and | internal | factors | were | detected | and | the | results | were | compared | to | some | measures | of | the | government | 's | pork | strategy

Pork | is | one | of | the | most | consumed | meat | in | the | world | and | pig | production | is | global | except | those | countries | where | pork | meat | is | not | consumed | due | to | cultural | and | religious | reasons | Together | with | poultry | the | pig | sector | is | the | fastest | growing | livestock | sector | According | to | FAO | data | FAO | 2009 | the | world | 's | pork | production | almost | doubled | between | 1987 | and | 2007 | from | 63.6 | million | tonnes | to | 115.5 | million | tonnes | While | in | 1987 | the | developed | countries | i.e. | former | centrally | planned | economies | and | other | developed | countries | produced | 58 | of | the | pork | meat | and | 42 | was | produced | by | developing | countries | of | Asia | Latin | America | and | Africa | in | 2007 | developed | countries | represented | 34 | of | the | world | pork | production | while | developing | countries | played | the | dominant | role | with | 66 | of | pork | meat | production

Pig | production | can | be | considered | as | double | faced | all | over | the | world | in | one | hand | it | is | represented | by | the | traditional | subsistence | driven | small | scale | production | while | the | specialized | industrial | farming | represents | the | other | Nevertheless | in | the | past | decades | the | major | improvements | in | pig | breeding | technologies | have | turned | the | commercial | pig | production | into | a | high | input | and | high | output | industry | Most | pigs | are | produced | on | specialised | farms | They | are | fed | with | concentrated | feed | and | kept | in | buildings | with | concrete | floors | producing | liquid | manure | which | represent | environmental | hazards | water | soil | and | air | pollution | The | changes | from | a | traditional | to | intensive | industrial | production | systems | were | associated | with | a | huge | increase | in | production | and | animal | densities | Meanwhile | in | the | past | decade | consumers | and | citizens | became | more | conscious | and | formulated | a | more | critical | opinion | about | intensive | production | systems | and | their | attention | turned | to | animal | welfare | environmental | impacts | product | quality | and | safety | Basset | Mens | and | van | der | Werf | 2005 | On | the | other | side | of | the | coin | the | popularity | of | outdoor | production | is | a | consequence | of | financial | considerations | low | investments | and | overhead | costs | and | the | need | for | more | extensively | produced | meat | Edwards | 2005 | Outdoor | production | is | also | often | perceived | to | be | more | environmentally | friendly | and | sustainable | consumers | often | perceive | that | meat | produced | in | outdoor | systems | is | more | nutritious | and | safer | with | lower | use | of | feed | additives | and | antibiotics | Nevertheless | these | system | may | be | applied | for | special | traditional | breeds | Bonneau | and | Lebret | 2010 | added | that | production | systems | have | significant | impacts | on | meat | quality | animal | density | and | animals | activity | The | sustainability | of | extensive | systems | is | depending | on | the | breed | the | traditions | the | market | need | and | the | location | The | top | producing | EU | countries | base | their | production | on | intensive | systems | with | large | fatteners | and | large | breeders | whereas | less | developed | and | new | member | states | have | more | small | fattener | farms | Fig | 1

The | pig | sector | was | one | of | the | most | important | sectors | of | the | Hungarian | agriculture | for | many | decades | as | Hungary | was | one | of | the | main | providers | of | the | former | socialist | countries | Pork | meat | represents | a | great | proportion | of | food | consumption | in | the | Hungarian | market | and | Hungary | has | long | time | traditions | in | the | pork | meat | processing | industry | as | well | After | the | political | and | economic | transition | the | situation | changed | fundamentally | Due | to | the | restructuring | of | the | agriculture | privatization | and | structural | changes | the | agricultural | production | decreased | in | all | transition | countries | which | still | determines | their | market | position

The | same | situation | was | observed | in | other | Central | Eastern | European | countries | Analysing | the | Czech | pig | market | Pourová | and | Pour | 2002 | concluded | that | the | problems | are | very | similar | in | the | following | aspects | distrust | between | the | players | of | the | supply | chain | varying | prices | strong | influence | of | the | processing | companies | Szymanska | 2015 | highlighted | that | the | Polish | pig | market | is | characterised | by | great | price | volatility | which | determines | the | profitability | of | pig | production | and | influences | the | level | of | income | generated | from | the | production | of | pigs | for | slaughter | A | general | problem | is | the | high | consumption | of | feed | per | kilogram | of | body | weight | gain | which | results | from | the | quantity | and | quality | of | feeding | stuff | In | Poland | and | Hungary | many | producers | still | prefer | ownproduced | feed | which | is | unbalanced | in | terms | of | the | compositions | of | essential | nutrients | with | a | significant | protein | deficiency | Nagy | Hryszko | and | Rycombel | 2014 | Vojtech | and | Peterková | 2015 | defined | the | three | key | areas | of | the | Czech | pig | producing | sector | dealing | with | issues | of | food | quality | and | safety | animal | welfare | and | environmental | requirements | Popp | and | Potori | 2010 | and | Rumánková | 2012 | highlighted | the | common | problem | of | Hungarian | and | Czech | 1 | Distribution | of | other | pigs | by | type | of | pig | farm | FSS | 2010 | Source | http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Pig_farming_sector_-_statistical_portrait_2014 | pig | sector | farmers | are | not | able | to | compete | with | foreign | farmers | and | their | cheap | imports | Due | to | the | constant | level | of | pork | consumption | decreasing | production | must | be | and | is | substituted | by | imports

In | the | past | two | years | the | problems | of | the | pig | sector | became | more | serious | as | a | result | of | the | Russian | import | sanctions | on | agricultural | products | Kraatz | 2014 | which | stopped | the | export | of | fresh | chilled | and | frozen | meat | and | even | salted | smoked | and | processed | products | like | sausages | to | the | Russian | Federation

As | the | main | goal | of | the | paper | was | to | give | an | outline | of | the | present | and | the | future | prospects | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | besides | the | comprehensive | literature | review | different | statistical | data | was | gathered | and | processed | for | the | analysis

For | the | background | calculations | of | the | analyses | the | authors | used | the | databases | of | the | Hungarian | Central | Statistical | Office | KSH | Eurostat | and | selected | data | from | the | FAO | database | using | long | term | statistical | data | from | the | 1970s | until | present | Databases | of | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | Public | Database | and | Hungarian | database | were | examined | from | the | date | of | Hungary | 's | EU | accession | 2004

The | results | of | the | calculations | on | the | profitability | efficiency | and | the | different | indicators | showing | the | financial | circumstances | of | the | players | of | the | pig | sector | are | not | included | in | this | paper | but | the | trends | the | main | indicators | and | the | financial | and | production | performance | of | the | pig | producing | enterprises | were | used | in | the | formulation | of | the | problem | tree | and | the | SWOT | analysis | The | present | situation | and | the | proposed | strategic | actions | were | summarized | and | described | based | on | the | problem | tree | by | the | SWOT | analysis | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | For | the | elaboration | of | the | problem | tree | and | the | SWOT | analysis | the | authors | made | a | comprehensive | literature | review | and | database | search | to | find | and | describe | the | driving | forces | of | the | pig | sector | In | the | course | of | the | analysis | the | proposed | strategic | steps | were | explored | and | compared | to | the | Hungarian | government | 's | pork | strategy

Pork | meat | forms | an | important | part | of | the | world | population | 's | diet | providing | a | high | quality | source | for | protein | requirements | of | the | consumers | It | is | consumed | worldwide | except | in | those | countries | where | the | it | is | noit | allowed | due | to | religious | reasons | or | cultural | traditions | The | main | pork | producers | represent | all | continents | of | the | world | and | countries | at | different | development | level

China | plays | the | leading | role | in | the | world | 's | pork | production | nearly | 55 | million | tonnes | of | production | The | second | is | the | European | Union | having | more | than | two | times | less | amount | of | pork | production | 23 | million | tonnes | the | third | is | the | USA | with | slightly | more | than | 11 | million | tonnes | of | meat | which | represents | one | fifth | of | the | Chinese | production | Brazil | 's | production | is | 3,5 | million | tonnes | while | Russia | produced | 2,6 | million | tonnes | in | 2015 | USDA | The | next | in | the | rank | are | Vietnam | Canada | Philippines | Mexico | and | Japan

The | total | production | of | the | EU-28 | was | about | 23 | million | tonnes | in | 2015 | The | most | important | producer | is | Germany | 5,562 | thousand | tonnes | it | is | followed | by | Spain | The | next | countries | in | this | rank | are | France | Poland | Denmark | Italy | and | the | Netherlands | roughly | with | the | same | production | level | Hungary | is | the | 11 | th | in | the | rank | Tab | I.

Consumers | mostly | from | Western | Europe | prefer | novel | processing | technologies | e.g. | marinating | or | shock | wave | treatments | that | enhance | the | tenderness | of | meat | are | being | experimented | with | However | consumers | seems | to | be | cautious | about | accepting | novel | technologies | for | food | processing | because | of | the | perceived | risks | and | lack | of | perceived | benefits | et | al | 2010 | Ngapo | Martin | and | Dransfield | 2007 | also | concluded | that | consumers | attitudes | and | their | preferences | are | strongly | determine | by | food | safety | and | food | quality | requirements | Consumers | will | require | the | latest | info | about | fresh | meat | and | meat | products

The | Hungarian | meat | consumption | showed | a | decreasing | tendency | in | the | past | decades | which | is | resulted | by | many | different | economic | and | social | factors

In | 2000 | the | total | meat | consumption | beef | and | veal | pork | poultry | other | meats | and | offal | consumption | was | about | 70 | kg | per | capita | per | year | which | decreased | by | ten | percent | until | 2005 | and | it | reached | 55.5 | kg | per | capita | in | 2013 | In | 2014 | the | total | meat | consumption | reached | 58.9 | kilograms | per | capita | i.e. | the | Hungarian | meat | consumption | is | just | over | 1 | kilogram | per | week | per | capita | The | composition | of | meat | consumption | is | represented | by | the | dominancy | of | pork | and | poultry | Based | on | the | KSH | Hungarian | Central | Statistical | Office | database | between | 2000 | and | 2015 | the | proportion | of | the | consumption | of | different | meats | should | be | considered | as | stable | 4 | 5 | is | beef | and | veal | consumption | 40 | 45 | is | pork | 43 | 48 | is | poultry | while | 6 | 8 | is | represented | by | other | meats | and | offal | consumption

The | main | feature | of | the | domestic | market | is | price | sensitivity | of | the | consumers | which | roots | in | the | general | economic | problems | of | Hungary | The | domestic | market | is | determined | by | the | consumption | level | while | the | chances | of | the | Hungarian | pork | products | are | influenced | by | the | other | EU | and | non | EU | producers | In | a | study | conducted | in | Western | European | countries | Stern | et | al | 2005 | concluded | that | the | main | issues | among | the | wide | public | were | food | safety | and | health | animal | welfare | and | animal | health | environmental | impact | and | the | price | of | pork | Their | report | concluded | that | in | Western | Europe | there | is | a | public | demand | for | more | sustainable | production | and | not | only | for | inexpensive | pork | Stern | et | al | 2005

Focusing | on | the | pork | production | the | situation | is | more | serious | when | compared | to | the | former | performance | of | the | sector | In | the | 1980s | Hungary | was | one | of | the | main | food | provider | of | the | eastern | bloc | the | main | market | was | the | former | Soviet | Union | The | number | of | pigs | was | the | highest | in | 1983 | when | 9,844,000 | pigs | and | 740,000 | breeding | sows | were | kept | in | the | country | In | the | 1990s | Hungary | lost | its | leading | role | in | exports | After | the | political | and | economic | changes | the | stable | market | collapsed | and | the | number | of | herds | decreased | radically

The | decrease | could | be | detected | in | pork | production | and | consumption | as | well | The | proportion | of | imports | increased | significantly | while | exports | -after | a | declining | stage | -seem | to | be | stabilized | The | main | data | of | Hungarian | pork | production | exports | imports | and | consumption | are | summarized | in | Tab | II | In | recent | years | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | showed | a | declining | trend | but | the | latest | data | shows | some | promising | data | for | the | future

Based | on | the | livestock | census | December | 2012 | the | number | of | pigs | -following | three | years | of | strong | decrease | -started | to | rose | slightly | and | since | then | the | increase | of | the | number | of | pigs | could | be | observed | Fig | 2

The | importance | of | the | need | for | the | development | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | was | highlighted | by | different | authors | even | before | the | EU | accession | Illés | and | Bíró | 1998 | and | Lehota | and | Illés | 2001 | described | the | opportunities | for | improving | the | competitiveness | of | the | sector | from | organizational | operational | and | efficiency | aspects | Their | results | highlighted | the | need | for | building | vertical | cooperation | between | the | players | of | the | supply | chain | small | and | large | scale | producers | slaughterhouses | processing | industry | traders | as | well | as | the | breeders | the | different | research | and

The | problem | tree | analysis | is | an | important | tool | of | mapping | out | main | problems | along | with | their | causes | and | effects | By | the | problems | it | is | possible | to | identify | clear | and | manageable | goals | and | the | strategy | of | how | to | achieve | them | The | problem | tree | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | is | described | by | Fig | 3

The | bottom | boxes | of | the | figure | represent | the | negative | aspects | of | the | existing | situation | The | boxes | in | the | middle | column | high | taxes | black | economy | the | loss | of | state | revenues | etc | identify | the | general | problems | of | livestock | sectors | The | middle | and | top | rows | of | the | figure | show | the | interdependence | of | the | different | elements | The | top | boxes | identify | the | final | impacts | of | the | problems

As | it | is | shown | by | the | problem | tree | the | roots | of | the | problems | are | determined | by | the | market | namely | the | changes | of | the | consumption | habits | particularly | the | price | sensitiveness | of | the | consumers | secondly | the | problems | are | caused | by | the | unfavourable | economic | environment | of | the | pig | sector | The | high | taxes | and | strict | requirements | may | support | the | existence | of | the | black | or | grey | economy | which | will | generate | additional | losses | of | state | revenues | The | Hungarian | pig | sector | shows | instability | because | of | these | economic | factors | which | is | also | influenced | by | the | technical | technological | problems | of | the | producers | These | complex | problems | initiated | the | development | and | implementation | of | the | new | Hungarian | Pork | Strategy

The | present | situation | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | is | summarized | by | a | SWOT | analysis | of | the | sector | which | is | comprehensive | result | of | former | literature | sources | Illés | and | Bíró | 1998 | Fórián | 2008 | Bartha | 2012 | and | our | own | researches | conducted | in | the | past | ten | years | Tab | III

The | SWOT | analysis | describes | the | internal | and | external | factors | affecting | the | environment | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | according | to | the | main | fields | and | activities | of | the | sector | consumption

More | developed | communication | between | the | players | of | the | sector | Formulation | of | a | complex | agricultural | strategy | Increase | of | energy | prices | Increase | of | the | feeding | stuff | prices | Environmental | legislation | is | a | significant | constraint | Source | own | research | trade | and | export | import | processing | production | and | breeding | It | shall | be | noted | that | it | is | a | general | overview | on | the | whole | sector | the | situation | might | be | different | if | examining | the | farms | and | enterprises | individually

The | strengths | of | the | sector | may | encourage | the | players | of | the | sector | and | it | is | promising | that | under | more | stable | economic | conditions | the | opportunities | also | could | be | reached | The | key | factor | of | the | future | success | is | strategy | development | but | for | establishing | the | appropriate | economic | background | of | the | sector | special | governmental | support | is | needed | as | the | support | from | different | EU | funds | are | specified | for | modernization | waste | management | plans | support | of | environmental | measures | rural | development | programmes | etc

As | it | was | shown | in | the | SWOT | analysis | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | has | many | strengths | which | are | mostly | derived | from | the | traditions | and | the | good | quality | of | the | products | Besides | the | strengths | of | the | sector | the | new | measures | of | the | Hungarian | Pork | Strategy | should | be | underlined | The | strategic | measures | were | announced | at | the | end | of | August | 2012 | and | were | adopted | by | the | Hungarian | government | The | Hungarian | government | allocated | 1.6 | billion | HUF | 5.2 | million | EUR | designed | to | boost | pig | breeding | and | pork | consumption | in | Hungary | The | pork | strategy | may | help | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | to | improving | product | quality | and | genetic | bases | to | create | various | quality | assurance | systems | The | programme | also | supports | the | promotion | of | domestically | produced | pork | meat | products | and | the | breeding | of | the | special | Mangalica | pigs | The | most | important | goals | of | these | measures | connected | to | increase | the | number | of | herds | and | to | improve | the | quality | of | meat | and | meat | products | Lack | of | cooperation | is | a | very | negative | phenomenon | of | the | sector | Different | Hungarian | and | foreign | authors | Udovecz | and | Nyárs | 2009 | Popp | and | Potori | 2010 | Boger | 2001 | Perez | De | Castro | and | Font | i | Furnouls | 2009 | highlighted | that | the | members | of | the | supply | chain | get | more | opportunities | by | collaboration | which | allows | them | to | become | more | competitive | than | if | they | stay | isolated | and | without | a | global | perspective | of | the | whole | chain | The | main | weaknesses | and | threats | are | connected | to | the | general | economic | and | structural | problems | of | the | Hungarian | agricultural | sector | i.e. | the | input | prices | exceed | product | prices | strict | environmental | legislation | the | lack | of | cooperation | and | spcialization | and | the | small | size | of | the | domestic | market | which | makes | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | more | dependent | on | the | foreign | markets | whith | very | sharp | competition

The | strategic | actions | needed | for | solving | the | abovementioned | problems | and | for | utilizing | the | strengths | and | opportunities | are | summarized | by | the | measures | Hungarian | Pork | Strategy

The | implementation | of | the | Hungarian | Pork | Strategy | has | already | been | started | The | main | goals | are | to | increase | both | the | pig | stock | and | pork | consumption

To | accelerate | this | process | the | Hungarian | government | aimed | at | doubling | the | number | of | pigs | in | the | next | 6 | 7 | years | Another | important | goal | is | to | solve | the | problem | of | the | black | market | This | could | be | done | by | the | full | implementation | of | standardized | registry | and | identification | system | The | reduction | the | VAT | on | live | and | half | pigs | from | 27 | percent | to | 5 | percent | can | also | support | this | process | and | after | the | first | experiences | this | measure | seems | to | be | successful | as | the | first | positive | changes | may | be | observed

A | severe | problem | may | arise | from | that | the | existing | production | capacity | is | out | of | date | new | slaughterhouses | and | modern | processing | plants | are | needed

In | Tab | IV | we | collected | the | most | important | steps | and | measures | concerning | the | pig | sector

The | Pork | Strategy | includes | different | measures | and | supporting | tools | which | may | help | in | the | recovery | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector

In | 2013 | the | processing | sector | was | supported | by | 400 | million | HUF | 1.3 | million | EUR | under | the | financial | scheme | of | the | strategy | where | the | support | of | research | and | development | activities | were | preferred | especially | increasing | the | proportion | of | domestically | produced | protein | in | pig | feed | and | improving | meat | quality | These | measures | may | improve | the | technology | problems | of | the | sector | particularly | in | feedstuff | utilization

A | government | decision | was | also | made | concerning | the | High | Quality | Pork | quality | assurance | system | and | trademark | which | main | features | are | the | following | the | meat | of | pig | bred | in | Hungary | fed | with | GMO | free | corn | and | other | cereal | based | feed | certified | in | the | EU | the | share | of | non | vegetable | origin | ingredients | must | be | below | 5 | percent | in | the | feed | The | introduction | of | this | quality | standard | will | represent | an | added | value | for | customers | so | it | may | motivate | the | health | conscious | and | demanding | consumers | as | well

Promotional | campaigns | of | Mangalica | products | is | another | important | part | of | the | pork | strategy | the | National | Association | of | Mangalica | Breeders | is | supported | for | establishing | a | certificate | of | origin | and | quality | assurance | system | while | Purebred | Pig | Breeders | Association | was | given | financial | help | for | improving | the | genetic | stock | of | Hungarian | pigs | and | for | finalizing | the | registry | system | This | system | which | issues | certificates | of | origin | and | ensuring | appropriate | quality | assurance | will | constitute | an | important | tool | in | acquiring | new | markets

A | production | and | market | information | system | https://sertesinfo.aki.gov.hu/ | was | developed | and | implemented | in | the | past | years | by | the | experts | of | the | Research | Institute | of | Agricultural | Economics | AKI | The | thematic | website | coordinates | already | existing | databases | and | systematises | their | data | focusing | on | the | number | of | pigs | quantity | data | and | market | processes | This | website | can | be | a | valuable | tool | for | the | players | of | the | pig | market | producers | suppliers | researchers | as | it | is | differentiated | according | to | the | needs | of | the | users | For | farmers | the | recent | market | data | applications | support | opportunities | etc | are | available | in | a | filtered | and | clustered | form | through | the | newsletter | while | researchers | can | find | comprehensive | market | and | technology | data | of | the | different | activities | and | processes | of | the | sector

An | outstanding | result | of | the | new | strategy | was | the | reduction | of | Value | Added | Tax | of | pork | meat | and | meat | products | which | stimulated | the | market | and | the | consumers | behaviour | positively | As | the | paper | 's | main | goal | was | to | provide | a | general | Of | course | the | Pork | Strategy | is | a | set | of | general | measures | which | may | contribute | to | the | recovery | and | future | success | of | the | sector | Nevertheless | the | implementation | and | the | successful | application | of | the | strategy | is | strongly | depending | on | the | attitudes | and | the | position | of | the | different | stakeholders | of | the | sector | i.e. | the | players | producers | breeders | farms | small | enterprises | large | companies | and | the | players | of | the | processing | industry | institutional | background | research | institutes | universities | governmental | institutions

In | recent | years | the | Hungarian | government | in | cooperation | with | professional | associations | farmers | processing | companies | research | institutions | etc | elaborated | a | comprehensive | Pork | Strategy | which | several | elements | have | already | been | implemented | The | programme | provides | help | for | the | players | of | the | Hungarian | pig | sector | for | producers | breeders | research | institutions | the | players | of | the | processing | industry | The | financial | support | may | improve | the | general | conditions | of | the | sector | and | may | create | a | more | stable | economic | and | administrative | background | for | all | the | parties | The | three | most | important | tasks | for | the | players | of | the | sector | are | the | following | establishing | a | stable | supply | chain | with | stable | markets | well | organized | sector | structure | and | welloperated | representative | bodies | improving | productivity | improving | production | indicators | and | efficiency | which | may | result | the | improvement | producers | bargaining | power | increasing | added | value | of | products | technology | development | and | product | development | by | the | help | of | financial | support

The | management | questions | of | agricultural | farms | are | another | key | issue | of | the | further | development

The | managerial | approach | the | managerial | skills | should | be | acquired | by | the | farmers | The | different | professional | associations | should | take | part | actively | in | this | process | by | organizing | trainings | exhibitions | workshops | for | providing | the | most | recent | information | to | the | producers | The | measures | of | the | pig | strategy | provided | some | financial | and | institutional | framework | for | achieving | these | goals | but | there | are | many | further | tasks | and | problems | to | be | solved | Close | cooperation | should | be | built | between | the | producers | increasing | the | trust | between | the | players | of | the | sector | is | also | needed | which | should | be | managed | by | the | players | themselves | External | help | and | reorganization | is | also | needed | for | example | between | financial | institutions | and | the | farmers | in | order | to | improve | the | financial | situation | of | the | producers | the | financing | opportunities | should | be | tailored | according | to | the | special | needs | and | conditions | of | the | pig | producers
