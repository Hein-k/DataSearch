Influence | of | intensive | water | management | and | water | quality | on | recreation | and | business | in | tourism | Deturope | 14(2 | 4 | 22

Tourism | is | one | of | the | most | important | socio | economic | phenomena | of | the | present | age | and | together | with | the | automotive | and | oil | industry | has | become | one | of | the | world | 's | largest | export | industries | The | purpose | of | the | tourist | industry | is | to | offer | tourists | satisfactory | extraordinary | memorable | and | valuable | experiences | Čaušević | et | al | 2021 | However | the | development | of | tourism | is | also | inherently | linked | to | far | reaching | impacts | both | positive | and | negative | A | strong | tourism | sector | directly | contributes | to | the | national | income | of | the | country | combats | unemployment | and | improves | the | balance | of | payments | Mavrommarti | et | al | 2021 | Tourism | can | also | make | enormous | economic | profits | for | the | area | bring | a | lot | of | jobs | for | the | locals | it | is | often | an | impulse | to | develop | infrastructure | and | help | increase | people | 's | education | in | areas | including | information | on | foreign | places | and | the | way | of | life | of | other | world | cultures

Conversely | the | development | of | tourism | must | also | have | its | limits | and | must | be | sustainable | for | the | area | Insensitive | tourism | development | can | disrupt | natural | and | social | conditions | in | the | area | suppress | local | culture | and | also | have | a | major | negative | impact | on | the | environment

Therefore | the | current | study | was | designed | to | analyse | and | valorise | the | conditions | of | provided | current | new | and | innovative | products | and | services | according | to | recent | trends | potential | of | given | locality | and | preferences | of | customers | which | have | influence | on | the | attractiveness | increase | of | turnout | and | increase | of | profits | with | the | support | of | marketing | communication | and | sales | promotion | of | offered | products | and | services

Tourism | leisure | time | and | recreation | are | concepts | that | belong | inseparably | to | each | other | but | their | meaning | is | different | For | example | Dumazedier | 1989 | defines | leisure | as | an | activityapart | from | obligations | of | work | family | and | society | -to | which | the | individual | turns | at | will | for | either | relaxation | diversion | or | broadening | his | knowledge | and | his | spontaneous | social | participation | the | free | exercise | of | his | creative | capacity | Veal | 2019 | Broadly | speaking | leisure | refers | to | the | free | time | that | people | can | spend | away | from | their | everyday | responsibilities | e.g. | work | and | domestic | tasks | to | rest | relax | and | enjoy | life | Gelná | Fialová | 2010 | 2011 | Fialová | et | al | 2018 | Whereas | recreation | refers | to | all | those | activities | that | people | choose | to | do | to | refresh | their | bodies | and | minds | and | make | their | leisure | time | more | interesting | and | enjoyable | e.g. | walking | swimming | meditation | reading | playing | games | and | dancing | etc | Khasnabis | et | al | 2010 | Recreation | itself | is | divided | into | passive | and | active | recreation | depending | on | the | age | and | socio | economic | characteristics | of | people | And | it | is | considered | that | active | recreation | includes | for | example | walks | in | nature | fishing | various | sports | hunting | etc | Coppock | Duffield | 1975 | On | the | other | hand | there | is | no | solid | definition | of | tourism | The | definition | of | tourism | by | UNWTO | 2010 | sees | tourism | as | a | subset | of | travel | where | travel | refers | to | the | activity | of | travellers | A | traveller | is | then | someone | who | moves | between | different | geographic | locations | for | any | purpose | and | any | duration | Next | to | this | definition | of | tourism | there | are | many | varieties | among | different | persons | and | sources | which | are | actually | based | on | two | basic | directions | The | first | direction | explains | tourism | from | a | participant | 's | point | of | view | and | addresses | its | content | motivation | activities | relationships | etc | The | second | one | mainly | focuses | on | the | institutions | and | the | various | sectors | providing | the | services | of | tourism | itself | Vystoupil | et | al | 2010

Tourism | is | divided | typologically | into | different | forms | and | types | depending | on | the | reasons | and | needs | of | the | participants | of | the | tourism | industry | as | well | as | the | duration | and | nature | of | the | objectives | Fialová | et | al | 2010 | In | this | context | stating | the | typology | of | tourism | it | has | been | described | that | tourism | has | two | basic | parts | -movement | and | consumption | influencing | the | environment | a | lot | Williams | 2009 | Gjorgievski | et | al | 2013 | For | example | Pásková | defines | tourism | from | the | point | of | view | of | geographic | economic | social | and | other | conditions | and | its | effects | and | the | way | it | is | carried | out | Pásková | 2008 | However | different | types | of | tourism | whose | division | is | rather | complex | have | been | described | in | full | details | by | Gjorgievski | and | colleagues | They | divide | tourism | by | several | criteria | -such | as | according | to | the | place | of | realization | domestic | and | foreign | active | and | passive | the | way | of | participation | and | forms | of | reimbursement | of | costs | free | and | tied | the | way | and | the | organization | of | services | not | organized | and | organized | often | excluded | tourism | outside | public | forms | -cabins | weekend | houses | etc | group | sizes | group | and | individual | duration | of | participation | short | and | long | term | time | rhythm | daily | weekend | weekly | and | longer | and | distribution | during | the | year | seasonal | year | round | Gjorgievski | et | al | 2013 | Another | classification | is | based | on | the | means | of | transport | used | the | prevailing | location | urban | suburban | rural | coastal | and | mountainous | agro | tourism | the | age | of | the | participants | or | the | impact | on | the | environment | soft | and | hard | Bacsi | Tóth | 2019 | and | the | use | of | natural | and | anthropogenic | resources | mass | consumer | alternative | and | sustainable

Likewise | there | are | three | categories | reflecting | the | various | factors | influencing | tourism

Among | them | the | first | is | a | group | of | natural | prerequisites | second | a | group | of | cultural | historical | prerequisites | and | finally | a | group | of | social | prerequisites | Vystoupil | et | al | 2010 | Hristov | 2015 | Currently | the | most | common | classification | of | tourism | and | recreation | prerequisites | divides | them | into | localization | prerequisites | including | natural | and | cultural | prerequisites | selective | prerequisites | and | finally | implementation | prerequisites | Williams | 2009

Localization | prerequisites | and | factors | influencing | tourism | are | those | that | include | natural | cultural | and | cultural | historical | features | where | natural | prerequisites | mean | the | relief | of | the | area | its | climatic | conditions | water | fauna | and | flora | Vystoupil | et | al | 2010 | Nature | based | tourism | is | one | of | the | tourism | forms | with | an | increasing | appeal | Bacsi | Szanati | 2021 | These | natural | conditions | most | influence | the | majority | of | tourism | and | recreation | activities | especially | their | residential | forms

Water | based | tourism | can | be | considered | as | a | special | part | of | nature | based | tourism | The | relationship | between | water | and | tourism | is | characterized | by | a | dual | understanding | of | this | element | as | a | precious | resource | and | as | an | attraction | As | a | tourist | attraction | water | represents | a | resource | with | a | strong | potential | to | attract | tourists | Different | types | of | bodies | of | water | can | sustain | several | diverse | forms | of | tourism | such | as | beach | tourism | river | tourism | tourism | of | reservoirs | lakes | and | natural | pools | and | tourism | of | thermal | waters | Folgado | Fernández | et | al | 2018

The | definition | of | water | based | tourism | according | to | Jennings | says | that | water | based | tourism | relates | to | any | touristic | activity | undertaken | in | or | in | relation | to | water | resources | such | as | lakes | dams | canals | creeks | streams | rivers | canals | waterways | marine | coastal | zones | seas | oceans | and | ice | associated | areas | Jennings | 2007 | Similarly | but | more | specifically | Hall | and | Harkönen | 2006 | define | lake | tourism | as | tourism | that | occurs | not | only | on | the | lake | itself | but | also | in | the | surrounding | area

The | significance | of | lake | tourism | lies | in | its | various | recreational | activities | Such | as | fishing | pilgrimage | or | activities | related | to | boating | surfing | or | yachting | for | example | Thanks | to | these | wide | possibilities | staying | by | the | water | is | a | very | desirable | form | of | spending | free | time | and | holidays | In | the | Czech | Republic | up | to | a | third | of | the | holiday | accommodation | base | is | located | around | the | water | areas | and | streams | Toušek | et | al | 2008 | Round | the | water | and | in | particular | near | the | mineral | springs | spas | are | built | as | an | example | of | longer | lasting | recreation | Flora | and | fauna | i.e. | plant | and | livestock | are | also | irreplaceable | The | plants | basically | shape | the | landscape | and | they | are | completely | dependent | on | the | natural | conditions | of | the | area | The | cultural | and | historical | prerequisites | as | the | second | component | of | the | localization | prerequisites | differ | from | the | natural | ones | by | being | created | by | human | activity | Williams | 2009 | Without | realization | prerequisites | it | would | not | be | possible | to | carry | out | tourism | and | recreation | itself | Vystoupil | et | al | 2010 | In | essence | they | create | a | link | between | tourism | and | recreation | areas | of | interest | and | destinations | and | tourism | and | recreation | areas | -in | other | words | the | link | between | demand | and | supply | There | are | nine | basic | functional | types | of | tourism | and | recreation | centers | in | the | Czech | Republic | -resorts | of | summer | recreation | near | the | water | mountain | resorts | of | summer | and | winter | recreation | historical | towns | and | centers | of | international | and | national | importance | historical | towns | of | non | regional | significance | other | towns | natural | attractions | spa | resorts | other | tourist | resorts | and | finally | the | most | important | centers | of | second | homes | Pásková | 2008 | Vystoupil | et | al | 2010

Generally | the | factors | are | classified | into | demographic | urbanization | economic | and | sociocultural | and | socio | political | groups | The | issue | of | sustainable | tourism | development | has | been | the | most | important | paradigm | of | tourism | geography | in | recent | decades | Currently | the | research | focuses | on | the | growing | importance | of | long | term | sustainable | tourism | and | the | sustainable | development | of | regions | and | cities | for | example | to | create | a | sustainable | urban | environment | it | is | crucial | to | identify | areas | of | opportunity | as | well | as | concern | and | to | respond | by | developing | realistic | sustainability | goals | with | a | long | term | perspective | Blagojević | et | al | 2020 | The | sustainable | approach | also | deals | with | the | impacts | on | the | natural | and | social | environment | and | seeks | to | optimize | these | impacts | through | strategic | tourism | planning | management | and | organization | Toušek | et | al | 2008

The | main | aim | of | this | paper | was | to | find | out | the | influence | of | intensive | water | management | in | ponds | and | related | water | quality | on | recreation | and | business | in | tourism | during | the | summer | months | in | the | Třeboň | region | For | this | purpose | the | hypothesis | was | set | as | Intensive | farming | in | ponds | and | related | water | quality | influences | tourism | and | business | in | the | region

The | method | of | observation | was | applied | during | a | statistical | survey | and | controlled | interviews | with | asked | participants | of | the | qualitative | and | the | quantitative | research | in | the | course | of | the | summer | season | 2020 | with | repetition | in | the | summer | season | 2021 | in | the | selected | area

The | Třeboň | region | was | selected | for | the | current | study | as | a | unique | water | system | consisting | of | ponds | and | connected | by | sewers | that | have | been | built | in | the | region | since | the | 14th | century | The | ponds | of | Třeboň | region | are | a | system | of | shallow | basins | of | different | size | 1 | 420 | ha | connected | by | sewers | The | ponds | were | built | in | a | flat | basin | drained | by | the | river | of | Lužnice | partly | by | the | Nežárka | river | Many | ponds | have | rugged | banks | with | richly | developed | littoral | stands | They | pass | into | communities | of | high | sedge | swamp | alder | and | willow | The | forests | around | the | ponds | are | predominantly | secondary | borne | and | spruce | forests | The | water | in | ponds | is | largely | atrophied | mesotrophic | only | in | some | small | ponds

Both | quantitative | and | qualitative | methods | of | research | were | used | as | these | methods | are | considered | very | beneficial | for | this | kind | of | research

Quantitative | research | is | based | on | positivism | and | it | is | supported | by | deduction | To | carry | out | quantitative | research | the | questionnaire | method | is | used | applicable | to | a | large | number | of | respondents | Personal | questionnaires | are | generally | used | for | assessing | customer | satisfaction | in | spite | of | their | expensive | and | time | consuming | character | because | questionnaires | can | provide | excellent | quality | information | Lőke | et | al | 2018 | It | is | also | easier | to | involve | the | participants | as | the | method | is | anonymous

There | are | three | approaches | to | quantitative | research | according | to | Veal | 2006

Type | A | hypothetical | deductive | quantitative | research | conforms | to | the | hypotheticaldeductive | model | discussed | under | positivism | earlier | This | model | is | implicit | in | many | discussions | of | quantitative | methods

Type | B | statistical | quantitative | research | makes | use | of | statistical | methods | and | tests | but | is | not | necessarily | hypothetical | deductive | It | can | be | descriptive | exploratory | and/or | deductive

Type | C | inductive | quantitative | research | is | based | on | numerical | data | but | makes | little | or | no | use | of | statistical | test | its | most | sophisticated | statistical | measures | are | usually | the | percentage | shares | and | sometimes | means | averages | Type | C | quantitative | research | is | more | informal | than | type | B | or | type | A | and | is | closer | in | approach | to | qualitative | methods

In | the | context | of | the | quantitative | research | based | on | the | deductive | approach | the | hypotheses | was | determined | and | verified | by | the | data | obtained | from | The | open | questions | were | asked | to | find | the | least | distorted | opinion | of | a | participant | The | closed | questions | were | mainly | of | a | general | nature | gender | education | etc | The | semi | closed | questions | that | combined | the | two | previously | mentioned | types | should | avoid | overriding | the | possibility | of | answering | the | question | For | the | scaling | of | the | responses | Likert | 's | scale | was | used | to | measure | the | respondent | 's | attitude | A | random | selection | was | used | to | choose | the | respondents | In | total | 289 | questionnaires | were | spread | in | the | areas | of | Hejtman | Chlum | u | Třeboně | Majdalena | the | ponds | of | Svět | and | Opatovický | rybník | Staňkov | and | Třeboň

Questionnaire | 2 | was | composed | of | 20 | questions | that | are | open | closed | and | semi | closed | In | total | 43 | questionnaires | were | spread | in | the | areas | of | Dvořiště | Hejtman | Chlum | Jemniča | Lomnice | nad | Lužnicí | Lutová | Lužnice | Opatovický | rybník | Staňkov | Svět | and | Třeboň

Questionnaire | 3 | consisted | of | 10 | questions | and | types | of | questions | and | the | evaluation | procedure | was | consistent | with | the | previous | procedures | for | questionnaires | 1 | and | 2 | The | questionnaire | was | distributed | among | 22 | mayors | and | deputy | mayors | of | the | territory | concerned | The | mayors | were | contacted | personally | by | email | and | by | phone

Qualitative | research | is | based | on | phenomenology | entomology | symbolic | interactionism | and | relies | on | induction | It | is | commonly | defined | as | non | quantitative | investigation | and | interpretation | of | social | reality | Disman | 2002 | Aguinis | Solarino | 2019 | Qualitative | research | is | an | addition | to | quantitative | research | and | is | aimed | at | uncovering | unknown | facts | about | social | and | socio | psychological | phenomena | including | the | existence | of | phenomena | their | characteristics | and | functions | and | factors | related | to | social | and | social | psychological | phenomena | Surynek | 2001 | Blair | 2015 | Qualitative | research | is | focused | on | the | behaviour | of | social | subjects

The | qualitative | research | was | conducted | in | the | form | of | a | semi | structured | interview | As | part | of | the | interview | technique | there | is | a | direct | encounter | between | the | interviewer | and | the | participant | The | interviewer | tries | to | get | information | by | asking | questions | that | reveal | experience | memories | and | knowledge | Through | the | interview | the | interviewer | identifies | attitudes | and | opinions | of | people | Surynek | 2001 | Zich | 2004 | The | basic | rule | is | to | ask | only | what | can | not | be | measured | determined | calculated | Surynek | 2001 | The | processing | of | the | data | obtained | from | the | interviews | was | done | by | the | coding | method | which | is | divided | into | the | basic | three | groups | open | coding | axial | coding | and | selective | coding | Aguinis | Solarino | 2019 | In | our | case | the | qualitative | research | only | supplemented | the | quantitative | research

Part | I.

The | first | part | is | focused | on | the | evaluation | of | visitors | survey | and | their | view | of | water | quality | in | the | recreational | area | of | Třeboň | region | There | was | a | total | of | 289 | participants | in | the | research | of | which | 133 | were | women | and | 156 | were | men | Among | them | 76 | learned | about | Třeboň | region | from | the | recommendations | of | people | they | know | and | only | 10 | from | the | internet | and | print | advertising

As | shown | in | Fig | 2a | the | Třeboň | region | can | be | regarded | as | a | popular | location | for | all | ages | however | most | respondents | were | aged | 31 | 40 | Mostly | they | were | from | the | Central | Bohemia | region | and | Vysočina | followed | by | the | region | of | South | Bohemia | Fig | 2b | A | similar | trend | has | prevailed | for | more | than | seven | years | as | revealed | by | comparison | with | previous | research

Similarly | most | of | the | respondents | came | to | the | Třeboň | region | with | a | partner | followed | by | the | family | holiday | with | school | aged | children | and | pre | school | children | see | Fig | 2c | They | come | for | the | adventure | brought | to | them | by | camping | and | cycling | We | found | that | 93 | of | the | visitors | get | to | the | region | by | car | which | they | sometimes | use | during | their | stay | Only | 5 | of | respondents | use | the | bus | and | train | link | The | trend | in | the | use | of | means | of | transport | has | changed | over | the | past | 5 | years | when | train | and | bus | connections | were | used | more | intensively | around | 20

The | data | showed | that | relaxation | is | the | most | common | reason | for | the | stay | 45 | followed | by | sport | and | active | tourism | 40 | and | the | nature | and | landscape | 11 | see | Fig | 2d

An | interesting | finding | is | the | respondents | awareness | of | the | Třeboňsko | Biosphere | Reserve | as | more | than | 55 | of | the | visitors | are | familiar | with | the | site | and | its | nature | see | Fig | 3a | A | positive | trend | is | related | to | repeated | visits | to | the | region | as | 57 | of | the | respondents | have | visited | Třeboň | region | more | than | three | times | and | only | 26 | have | visited | the | site | for | the | first | time | see | Fig | 3b | This | fact | is | also | influenced | by | the | satisfaction | of | visitors | with | the | services | they | use | during | their | stay

Třeboň | region | is | gradually | becoming | a | popular | holiday | destination | where | visitors | stay | for | three | to | seven | nights | From | previous | research | seven | years | ago | it | was | obvious | that | people | here | stayed | for | the | weekend | and | the | extended | weekend | At | present | this | limit | is | shifted | to | weekly | stays | see | Fig | 3c

The | evaluation | of | the | services | in | Třeboň | region | was | determined | by | other | research | questions | Quality | and | satisfaction | with | services | are | rated | by | 49 | of | the | respondents | as | very | good | and | only | 2 | see | them | as | insufficient | see | Fig | 3d

An | extended | stay | of | visitors | means | a | higher | reputation | for | service | providers | and | better | profit | On | average | a | person | spends | from | 400 | to | 700 | -CZK | per | day | as | reported | by | 42 | of | the | respondents | 34 | of | respondents | spend | to | 400 | -CZK | per | person | per | day | see | Fig | 4a

During | their | stay | 77 | of | respondents | use | the | ponds | for | swimming | 19 | do | not | use | it | because | of | other | sports | activities | and | illnesses | as | reported | in | the | questionnaire | survey | Only | 4 | of | respondents | do | not | use | them | due | to | pollution | and | poor | water | quality | see | Fig | 4b

The | respondents | using | the | ponds | for | swimming | assess | the | water | quality | in | the | following | way | 50 | of | respondents | find | it | satisfactory | 44 | average | 4 | worsening | and | only | 2 | as | dissatisfactory | see | Fig | 4c | The | visitors | do | not | see | the | semi | intensive | farming | in | the | ponds | as | a | negative | phenomenon | they | see | it | as | a | part | of | an | intensive | production | 9 | of | the | respondents | perceive | the | loss | of | biodiversity | that | they | associate | with | the | increasing | pond | management | only | 7 | of | the | respondents | have | seen | the | negative | impact | of | the | management | on | water | quality | see | Fig | 4d | A | total | of | 77 | of | respondents | are | satisfied | in | the | region | 33 | lack | better | quality | of | the | social | facilities | in | camps | poor | serviceability | non | binding | cycling | routes | higher | number | of | services | and | information | boards | 82 | of | the | respondents | do | not | see | any | issues | in | the | region

the | remaining | 18 | are | bored | by | a | large | number | of | bikers | poor | labelling | and | higher | prices

The | research | shows | that | the | Třeboň | region | is | one | of | the | most | popular | destinations | where | visitors | want | to | come | back | A | total | of | 69 | of | respondents | already | knew | at | the | time | of | the | survey | that | they | would | visit | the | site | next | year | and | 25 | would | visit | it | sometime | later

Part | II

The | second | part | of | the | research | was | aimed | at | the | providers | of | accommodation | catering | and | other | facilities | in | the | region | The | aim | of | the | survey | was | to | find | out | whether | the | management | of | ponds | and | the | associated | quality | of | water | had | an | impact | on | the | recreation | and | tourism | businesses | In | total | 43 | providers | from | the | area | of | Hejtman | Staňkov | Svět | Třeboň | Chlum | Lutová | Svět | Lomnice | nad | Lužnicí | Opatovický | rybník | Dvořiště | and | Jemčina | took | part | in | the | survey | 53 | of | respondents | have | been | active | in | the | region | for | more | than | nine | years | see | Fig | 5a | given | the | fact | that | they | are | able | to | compare | the | current | situation | to | the | situation | ten | years | ago

More | than | a | half | of | the | respondents | 53 | come | from | the | region | and | they | run | their | business | here | and | 21 | of | the | providers | have | lived | in | the | area | for | a | long | time | and | run | their | business | here | Fig | 5b | This | finding | provides | us | with | an | adequate | sample | to | assess | the | state | of | the | region | in | connection | with | the | increase | in | intensive | tourism | Dvořáková | Líšková | Z. | Škodová | Parmová | D. | Fehér | A. | Novotná | J. | Krogmann | A.

Regarding | age | 30 | of | the | providers | in | the | survey | are | 41 | 50 | years | of | age | 23 | of | 51 | 60 | years | old | see | Fig | 5c | The | mentioned | respondents | already | have | experience | with | business | in | the | region | and | know | the | strengths | and | weaknesses | of | the | site | in | detail

Based | on | the | qualitative | interviews | it | was | found | that | the | entrepreneurs | are | more | aware | of | the | needs | and | weaknesses | of | the | region | unlike | larger | enterprises | employing | nine | and | more | employees | The | retailers | are | more | dependent | on | other | services | in | the | region | compared | to | larger | guest | houses | and | hotels | that | provide | most | of | the | complex | services | on | their | own

There | are | different | types | of | activity | in | which | the | respondents | run | the | business | including | catering | services | as | the | most | common | ones | to | bike | and | water | sports | rentals

The | 51 | of | the | respondents | are | self | employed | persons | and | 28 | of | them | are | employers | having | up | to | three | employees

The | next | part | of | the | questionnaire | was | aimed | at | the | satisfaction | of | the | providers | with | local | administration | The | survey | was | also | focused | on | the | extent | to | which | the | providers | are | informed | about | the | strategic | plans | in | the | region

Working | together | with | the | local | authorities | was | rated | as | excellent | by | 14 | providers | as | very | good | by | 8 | providers | 13 | of | them | rated | it | as | good | 3 | as | sufficient | and | only | 5 | as | insufficient | The | dissatisfaction | with | the | authorities | was | mainly | addressed | by | small | businesses | and | one | provider | with | more | than | nine | employees | from | the | localities | of | Staňkov | Lutová | and | Lomnice | nad | Lužnicí

The | communication | between | the | private | and | public | sectors | through | the | awareness | of | the | intentions | of | the | towns | and | the | region | is | evaluated | by | 15 | respondents | as | excellent | very | good | or | good | by | 18 | respondents | 4 | as | adequate | and | only | 6 | respondents | see | it | as | insufficient | the | others | did | not | know | how | to | rate | the | situation | The | administrative | procedure | is | not | satisfying | for | 5 | operators | only | who | have | been | running | the | business | in | the | region | for | more | than | eight | years | and | are | mainly | from | Lutová | Staňkov | Svět | and | Lomnice | nad | Lužnicí

An | interesting | finding | is | related | to | the | dissatisfaction | with | the | transport | infrastructure | as | 14 | respondents | rated | it | as | insufficient | especially | from | the | localities | of | Lutová | Staňkov | Chlum | Třeboň | The | inadequate | transport | infrastructure | has | been | in | place | for | more | than | 5 | years | its | reconstruction | has | been | going | on | for | a | long | time | and | inefficiently

The | evaluation | of | the | technical | infrastructure | is | more | favorable | in | comparison | with | the | transport | infrastructure | as | reported | by | the | respondents | as | only | 5 | respondents | expressed | dissatisfaction | 7 | respondents | rated | it | excellent | and | 14 | respondents | as | good | The | technical | infrastructure | has | improved | significantly | in | 10 | years | and | the | trend | of | innovation | is | obvious

The | providers | of | accommodation | catering | and | other | facilities | would | welcome | support | for | procurement | information | on | development | plans | and | construction | of | sewage | systems | from | the | municipality | Respondents | in | many | cases | did | not | have | a | specific | idea | of | what | they | would | like

The | next | part | of | the | survey | is | focused | on | the | evaluation | of | water | quality | issues | and | their | impact | on | business | As | shown | in | Fig | 5a | 51 | of | respondents | reported | a | decrease | in | water | quality | over | the | last | 10 | years | mostly | in | the | areas | of | Chlum | Lutová | Třeboň | Hejtman | Svět | Lomnice | nad | Lužnicí | Lužnice | The | main | cause | of | pollution | is | seen | in | climate | change | which | affects | not | only | the | Třeboň | region | Another | cause | of | pollution | is | the | intensive | management | of | ponds | focused | solely | on | the | production | of | carp | 35 | of | the | respondents | did | not | see | any | change | in | water | quality | 14 | of | the | respondents | reported | better | quality | mostly | in | the | areas | of | Dvořiště | Chlum | Hejtman | Svět | such | respondents | have | been | active | in | the | region | for | more | than | 5 | years

Another | question | was | focused | on | the | impact | of | water | quality | on | business | As | revealed | in | Fig | 6b | 37 | of | the | respondents | see | no | influence | on | their | business | 26 | reported | a | positive | influence | and | only | 9 | reported | a | highly | negative | influence | 51 | of | respondents | in | preserving | carp | farming | followed | by | increasing | the | share | of | the | ponds | with | the | possibility | of | sports | fishing | see | Fig | 6c

The | results | of | the | research | show | that | the | quality | of | the | water | in | the | Třeboň | region | ponds | is | evaluated | as | satisfactory | both | by | most | of | the | tourists | and | the | providers | There | is | a | conflict | of | interests | mainly | in | Staňkov | where | the | entrepreneurs | negotiate | with | the | management | of | the | ponds | The | quality | of | water | in | ponds | does | not | have | a | major | impact | on | business | activities | and | does | not | limit | the | attendance | of | the | camp | sites | The | area | of | Třeboň | region | is | a | repeatedly | visited | locality | where | people | return | several | times | and | the | time | of | stay | is | gradually | increasing | from | weekend | stays | to | weekly | stays

The | third | part | of | the | study | is | focused | on | local | governments | and | 22 | mayors | and | vice | mayors | from | the | municipal | authorities | of | Třeboň | region | were | addressed | The | purpose | was | to | find | out | attitudes | and | opinions | of | the | public | administration | on | the | impact | of | intensive | farming | in | the | ponds | and | water | quality | management | on | recreation | and | tourism | businesses | All | the | municipalities | addressed | had | a | strategic | document | on | the | development | of | the | region | designed | either | completely | or | at | least | partially | Based | on | qualitative | interviews | it | was | found | that | only | 40 | of | the | respondents | had | a | complex | strategic | document | approved | by | the | council | 30 | of | the | respondents | stated | having | a | document | called | Development | Plan | though | lacking | a | system

The | remaining | 30 | reported | having | a | 10 | to-15 | page | document | of | which | 10 | pages | dealt | with | history | and | cultural | and | historical | sites | of | the | village

Another | area | of | the | survey | is | the | quality | of | water | however | the | local | governments | were | rather | afraid | to | discuss | such | an | issue | because | of | political | reasons | as | a | number | of | enterprises | contribute | to | the | development | of | infrastructure | help | with | subsidies | therefore | the | representatives | were | careful | when | responding | Therefore | it | is | not | possible | to | see | the | answers | to | this | question | as | significant | 45 | of | the | respondents | have | not | seen | a | change | in | water | quality | over | the | past | 10 | years | Even | 23 | see | the | change | for | the | better | The | respondents | who | see | deterioration | in | water | quality | report | climate | change | as | the | main | reason | for | it | 73 | only | 27 | see | the | pond | management | as | the | reason | In | the | qualitative | interviews | more | than | 50 | of | the | respondents | pointed | out | that | there | was | not | intensive | but | semi | intensive | farming | The | quality | of | water | in | local | ponds | has | a | great | impact | on | tourism | but | on | the | basis | of | the | number | of | tourists | the | respondents | are | convinced | that | water | quality | is | good | The | respondents | report | that | they | are | in | touch | with | pond | management | operators | and | they | assess | their | relationships | as | standard | The | local | authorities | the | respondents | believe | that | for | the | future | development | of | the | region | it | is | necessary | to | maintain | the | traditions | and | related | management | of | ponds | while | increasing | the | share | of | ponds | with | the | possibility | of | sports | fishing | which | will | also | lead | to | a | higher | quality | of | water

In | conclusion | the | data | obtained | in | the | current | research | supports | the | rejection | of | the | hypothesis | saying | that | intensive | farming | in | ponds | and | related | water | quality | influences | tourism | and | business | in | the | region | The | results | showed | that | visitors | providers | of | catering | accommodation | and | other | facilities | as | well | as | local | authorities | think | that | the | management | of | ponds | and | the | associated | water | quality | have | an | impact | on | tourism | and | business | in | the | region

The | attitude | of | the | tourists | and | the | providers | who | do | not | consider | the | water | in | the | ponds | to | be | heavily | polluted | is | crucial | as | they | do | not | see | the | pond | management | as | a | major | problem | Local | governments | perceive | the | situation | as | a | problem | but | they | are | afraid | to | comment | on | it | for | reasons | previously | mentioned | sponsorship | infrastructure | financing | etc | Furthermore | the | obtained | data | highlighted | the | most | developed | types | of | tourism | in | the | Třeboň | region | including | cultural | sports | spa | gastronomic | congress | and | sustainable | tourism | Cultural | tourism | is | popular | in | the | area | especially | due | to | the | presence | of | important | cultural | sites | However | the | number | of | visitors | of | the | sites | is | strongly | influenced | by | seasonality | which | causes | uneven | revenues | of | the | local | entrepreneurs | There | is | no | demonstrable | deterioration | in | the | status | of | historical | objects | in | relation | to | the | number | of | visitors | and | therefore | there | is | no | need | to | reduce | their | attendance

This | fact | is | especially | obvious | in | the | supply | and | demand | of | gastronomic | facilities | The | existence | of | ponds | affects | the | overall | image | of | the | area | Tourism | is | further | influenced | by | fish | farming | which | is | typical | for | the | area | Tourists | here | have | the | opportunity | to | get | acquainted | with | the | history | of | fish | farming | in | the | Czech | Republic | Fishing | itself | however | is | not | very | attractive | among | the | tourists | The | spa | complexes | attract | the | tourists | throughout | the | year | It | is | mainly | the | center | of | the | area | the | town | of | Třeboň | where | the | complexes | are | located | Spa | guests | do | not | move | only | in | the | spa | areas | but | also | use | the | services | outside | They | are | the | most | frequent | visitors | to | theatres | concerts | and | exhibitions | among | tourists | so | it | is | appropriate | to | tailor | the | programs | of | these | events | to | such | guests | Recently | the | importance | of | rural | tourism | agro | tourism | and | eco | tourism | has | also | increased | These | types | of | tourism | have | minimal | negative | impacts | on | the | area | and | it | is | therefore | appropriate | to | support | their | development

Moreover | they | should | contribute | to | the | preservation | of | the | rural | environment | demographic | condition | and | cultural | heritage | Gajić | et | al | 2019 | Tourism | in | the | area | of | the | ponds | in | South | Bohemia | is | a | highly | developed | sector | employing | a | significant | part | of | the | population | The | occupancy | of | the | area | was | also | determined | The | Defert´s | function | was | used | for | this | purpose

This | function | expresses | the | intensity | of | tourism | in | the | municipality | by | the | ratio | between | the | density | of | potential | visitors | spending | the | night | in | a | tourism | facility | that | provides | accommodation | services | in | the | municipality | and | the | population | of | the | municipality | Pásková | 2008 | According | to | the | results | of | Defert | 's | tourist | function | Třeboň | region | is | an | area | with | a | significant | but | not | overwhelming | tourist | activity | For | the | healthy | functioning | of | the | region | the | emphasis | should | also | be | put | on | the | development | of | other | economic | sectors | that | are | suppressed | to | a | certain | extent | by | the | tourism | industry | The | main | issues | are | related | to | the | transport | infrastructure | and | also | to | the | decreasing | number | of | permanent | residents | in | the | main | tourist | centers | due | to | the | increasing | hostility | towards | tourists | In | evaluating | the | internal | and | external | environment | SWOT | analysis | the | strengths | of | tourism | over | the | weaknesses | and | the | opportunities | over | the | threats | were | identified | For | sustainable | tourism | development | it | is | advisable | to | focus | on | preserving | the | strengths | and | maximizing | the | opportunities | Therefore | it | is | necessary | to | put | the | emphasis | on | preserving | the | quality | of | the | environment | the | landscape | and | the | cultural | heritage | offered | by | the | area | The | increase | in | the | number | of | tourists | is | not | desirable | for | the | Třeboň | region | as | the | increasing | attendance | could | increase | the | risk | of | negative | impacts | of | the | weaknesses | and | the | increasing | importance | of | the | threats

Based | on | the | research | some | measures | were | proposed | to | enhance | sustainable | development

The | first | measure | is | to | modify | and | regulate | the | information | boards | leading | to | preservation | of | the | landscape | character | of | the | area | and | reduction | of | negative | ecological | impacts | The | second | proposal | is | to | hold | historical | markets | in | the | premises | of | the | Třeboň | Chateau | with | the | involvement | of | the | providers | of | sustainable | tourism | services | The | aim | is | to | suppress | the | seasonality | of | visiting | cultural | monuments | the | chateau | and | the | promotion | of | sustainable | forms | of | tourism | Třeboň | region | is | however | typical | of | its | beautiful | landscape | and | nature | as | a | part | of | the | Protected | Landscape | Area | The | construction | of | new | buildings | would | be | a | further | interference | to | the | landscape | and | the | environment | It | is | therefore | not | desirable | in | this | location

The | problem | is | in | particular | the | insufficient | sports | facilities | that | could | be | used | in | bad | weather

Beer | most | likely | first | came | about | by | accident | noted | Dulye | and | Herz | 2018 | 4 | who | surmise | that | Neolithic | people | in | the | middle | east | grew | barley | ground | it | into | gruel | then | experimented | with | additional | ingredients | including | bitter | herbs | such | as | turmeric | They | propose | that | this | mixture | became | colonised | with | wild | yeast | and | was | then | fermented | to | produce | an | early | form | of | beer | Subsequently | different | styles | of | fermented | beverages | developed | influenced | by | variable | climates | and | the | availability | and | flavours | of | local | ingredients | hence | regional | and | local | styles | of | beer | emerged | Additionally | the | evolution | of | beer | has | been | shaped | by | religious | political | economic | and | social | factors | Dulye | Herz | 2018

Traditionally | beer | has | been | consumed | without | food | and | has | even | been | classified | as | a | food | cf

Chemistry | World | 1996 | whereas | wine | has | often | been | matched | or | paired | with | food | In | most | European | countries | the | drink | drive | laws | have | had | a | powerful | effect | on | the | consumption | of | alcohol | In | attempts | to | increase | their | sales | many | public | houses | are | offering | food | throughout | the | day | to | supplement | their | profits | from | alcohol | sales | Recently | the | focus | on | healthy | eating | is | reflected | in | menu | offerings | via | healthy | options | and | calorie | counts | Beer | contains | fewer | calories | measure | for | measure | than | wine | milk | or | fruit | juice | with | spirits | having | more | than | six | times | the | calories | of | beer | Clarke | Roux | 2007 | 43 | so | it | should | be | given | serious | consideration | in | this | context | Also | in | its | favour | it | has | been | mooted | that | because | the | ingredients | and | brewing | processes | in | beer | are | wider | ranging | beer | offers | more | diverse | flavours | and | is | much | less | concentrated | than | wine | in | the | key | sensory | components | that | react | significantly | with | food | flavours | and | textures | that | is | alcohol | acid | and | tannin | Block | 2012 | so | it | is | argued | that | beer | is | a | preferable | choice | for | food | matching | Based | on | these | premises | using | the | findings | from | primary | research | in | CEE | the | present | paper | examines | ways | in | which | food | and | beer | may | be | matched | taking | account | of | possible | cultural | preferences | and | responds | to | five | research | questions | The | response | to | the | final | sixth | research | questions | puts | the | primary | research | into | a | tourism | context | in | particular | with | reference | to | destination | management | and | marketing | sense | of | place | and | Slow | Food

The | initial | purpose | of | the | present | study | was | to | inspire | publicans | and | restaurateurs | and | in | turn | consumers | to | move | towards | this | potentially | more | palatable | more | flexible | and | healthier | option | of | food | and | beer | matching | In | turn | based | on | these | findings | the | aim | of | the | present | research | is | to | put | forward | menu | suggestions | to | promote | local | products | so | attracting | local | guests | as | well | as | domestic | and | international | tourists | to | sample | and | enjoy | the | tasting | experiences | Sparks | Bowen | Klag | 2003 | also | stated | the | importance | of | the | F&B | experience | in | attracting | tourists | to | destinations | while | Sims | 2009 | pointed | out | that | food | plays | an | important | role | in | tourism | and | local | food | can | provide | a | tourist | with | a | bond | to | the | area | and | to | local | culture | and | heritage | thereby | improving | the | quality | of | the | tourist | experience | Therefore | in | the | context | of | the | findings | recommendations | are | made | for | destination | and | local | business | managers | and | further | research

For | several | decades | advisory | textbooks | for | example | Beckett | 2002 | Bell | Johnson | 1999 | Robinson | 1987 | St | Pierre | 2001 | and | numerous | menu | recommendations | have | been | made | for | matching | and/or | pairing | food | and | wine | Researchers | have | reported | ideal | food | and | wine | pairings | with | for | example | 33 | burgundy | grand | crus | Lecat | Chapuis | 2017 | so | promoting | food | and | wine | tourism | cf | Croce | Perri | 2010 | Santeramo | Seccia | Nardone | 2017

Pairing | suggestions | on | the | menu | for | food | with | wine | by | the | glass | were | shown | by | Terrier | and | Jaquinet | 2016 | to | increase | the | sales | of | wine | by | the | glass | significantly | they | discuss | practical | applications | of | this | strategy | Searches | indicate | that | most | of | the | food | and | beverage | F&B

pairing | and | matching | literature | and | practice | focusses | on | wine | there | is | only | sparse | research | on | food | and | beer | pairing | and | matching

Nevertheless | there | are | numerous | articles | in | the | trade | press | with | corresponding | advice | on | food | outlet | websites | predominantly | from | the | USA | claiming | to | guide | diners | regarding | specific | recommendations | for | food | and | beer | pairings | for | example | Cole | 2013 | Kallas | 2011 | Mather | 2014 | The | staff | 2011 | but | very | few | cover | the | broader | spectrum | of | food | and | beer | matching | for | example | Block | 2012 | Foottit | 2011 | Michel | Roux | Jr. | 2006 | 10 | experimented | by | serving | Liefman | 's | Kriek | cherry | beer | with | a | spicy | seared | tuna | dish | and | it | was | so | successful | he | decided | to | add | beer | to | his | menu | in | London | In | the | past | beer | has | often | been | neglected | in | top | restaurants | and | perceived | merely | as | a | thirst | quencher | I | believe | that | beer | should | be | perceived | as | a | sophisticated | gourmet | drink | a | sophisticated | drink | that | goes | wonderfully | with | food | beer | is | indeed | beginning | to | rival | wine | 's | traditional | standing | as | food | 's | best | friend | Clarke | Roux | 2007 | 43 | Subsequently | Mather | 2014 | 21 | advised | consumers | to | ask | an | expert | the | beer | sommelier | who | is | a | trained | professional | who | specialises | in | the | service | and | knowledge | of | beer

The | ingredients | of | beer | of | which | there | are | two | main | types | -ale | and | lager | are | water | over | 90 | malted | barley | hops | and | yeast | the | latter | determines | whether | the | beer | is | an | ale | or | a | lager | The | difference | is | that | ale | yeasts | collect | on | the | top | during | fermentation | and | ales | ferment | at | warmer | temperatures | 60 | 75 | o | F | than | lager | yeasts | which | are | bottom | fermenting | at | cooler | 40 | 60 | o | F | temperatures | http://homebrewacademy.com/beer-ingredients/ | In | consequence | ales | are | heavier | bodied | and | more | complex | for | example | stout | and | India | pale | ale | IPA | whereas | lagers | tend | to | be | light | and | crisp | such | as | pilsner | style | beers | http://homebrewacademy.com/beer-ingredients/ | A | less | common | yeast | weizen | wheat | is | used | in | some | German | wheat | beers | such | as | Hefeweizen

A | by | product | of | fermentation | is | carbon | dioxide | gas | CO2 | which | is | sometimes | introduced | by | force | carbonation | measured | in | volumes | of | dissolved | gas | per | volume | of | liquid | with | 2.5 | to | 2.7 | being | the | most | common | as | can | nitrogen | which | creates | smaller | bubbles | and | a | softer | mouth | feel | than | CO2 | Dulye | Herz | 2018 | The | pH | score | measures | the | alkalinity | 7 | or | acidity | 7 | of | a | liquid | with | tap | water | having | a | pH | of | 7 | sour | beer | styles | post | fermentation | are | in | line | with | red | wine | pH | 3.3 | 3.6 | the | pH | of | most | beer | styles | post | fermentation | is | 4 | 4.5 | Dulye | Herz | 2018 | The | colour | Standard | Reference | Method | SRM | for | beer | ranges | from | light | yellow | 1 | 1.5 | straw | 2 | 3 | pale | 4 | gold | 5 | 6 | light | amber | 7 | amber | 8) | medium | amber | 9 | copper | garnet | 10 | 12 | saddle | brown | 16 | 17 | dark | brown | 18 | 24 | dark | 25 | 39 | to | black | 40 | Dulye | Herz | 2018 | Usually | colour | is | determined | by | the | drying | or | malting | of | germinated | barley | grains | the | longer | and | hotter | the | barley | is | kilned | the | darker | it | becomes | Roberts | 2015

Effects | of | beer | on | the | sense | of | taste | The | sense | of | taste | is | activated | when | certain | classes | of | chemicals | contact | specialised | epithelial | taste | receptor | cells | in | the | tongue | palate | throat | and | sometimes | near | the | epiglottis | and | the | upper | oesophagus | Breslin | Spector | 2008 | R148 | They | explain | that | taste | is | a | function | of | touch | related | to | the | sensation | of | F&Bs | on | our | palates | and | comment | that | most | researchers | categorise | taste | perceptions | into | one | or | more | combinations | of | sweet | umami | salt | sour | and | bitter | they | recognise | and | attribute | individual | differences | in | taste | to | genetics | and | environmental | factors | cf | Risso | et | al | 2017 | Most | taste | perceptions | are | composed | also | of | distinct | additional | attributes | intensity | hedonic | oral | localisation | and | temporal | features | rise | and | decay | and | aftertaste | Breslin | Spector | 2008 | R151

The | affective | or | hedonic | component | of | a | taste | refers | to | whether | the | stimulus | is | liked | or | disliked | Without | question | the | hedonic | domain | of | taste | function | can | be | characterised | by | its | fundamental | role | in | food | selection | and | the | control | of | intake | in | both | humans | and | animals | Breslin | Spector | 2008 | R154 | Prescott | 1998 | in | making | intercultural | taste | comparisons | suggested | that | familiarity | with | the | products | has | an | important | influence | on | individual | tastes | and | in | consequence | individual | likes | or | dislikes | more | recently | Arellano | Covarrubias | Gómez | Corona | Varela | and | Escalona | Buendía | 2019 | noted | cultural | differences | in | beer | flavour | pairings | Furthermore | cultural | preferences | may | change | when | consumers | move | from | one | culture | to | another | suggesting | that | familiarity | with | taste | can | influence | their | choices | so | food | and | beer | are | best | matched | locally | Betancur | Motoki | Spence | Velasco | 2020

Additionally | although | training | has | been | shown | to | improve | tasters | ability | to | identify | discriminate | amongst | and | match | beers | it | appears | that | such | benefits | do | not | generalise | to | beers | not | experienced | during | training | Van | Doorn | Watson | Timora | Spence | 2020

As | the | styles | of | beer | continue | to | expand | personal | preferences | which | have | been | attributed

to | biological | psychological | and | socio | cultural | factors | including | national | and | regional | ethnocentricity | may | come | to | the | fore | cf | Betancur | et | al | 2020 | Furthermore | productintrinsic | attributes | i.e. | the | sensory | aspects | of | the | beer | per | se | and | product | extrinsic | attributes | i.e. | external | sensory | characteristics | for | example | packaging | in | addition | to | contextual | and | environmental | influences | such | as | familiarity | habit | peer | preferences | location | context | occasion | and | reason | for | drinking | etc | have | become | evident | in | line | with | food | preferences | for | example | Betancur | et | al | 2020 | Siemieniako | Kubacki | Glińska | Krot | 2011 | Therefore | to | allow | for | personal | preferences | and | to | accommodate | the | hedonic | domain | of | the | taste | function | in | individuals | the | present | study | focuses | on | food | and | beer | matching | as | opposed | to | food | and | beer | pairing

Prior | to | tasting | beer | its | visual | and | olfactory | features | should | be | noted | they | include | colour | clarity | head | lacing | carbonation | and | smell | for | example | fruit | bread | sugar | spice | etc | On | tasting | the | beer | acidity | bitterness | sweetness | fruitiness | hops | etc | accompany | the | mouth | feel | which | may | be | warming | effervescent | with | body | smooth | or | balanced | The | aftertaste | follows | http://www.qblp.com/education/beer-tasting-101/ | Taking | the | scientific | perspective | Brányik | Vicente | Dostálek | and | Teixeira | 2008 | remark | that | certain | flavour | active | compounds | in | continuous | fermentation | systems | can | control | the | flavour | of | beer | so | that | characterising | its | taste | only | by | the | analytical | determination | of | some | of | its | components | is | too | simplistic | They | believe | that | in | practice | the | flavour | of | some | compounds | is | suppressed | or | accentuated | by | others | and | the | final | taste | profile | results | from | the | interplay | of | various | taste | features

Furthermore | they | state | that | beer | flavour | is | influenced | by | beer | type | and | circumstances | which | depend | on | country | of | origin | and | fashion | In | addition | numerous | technological | parameters | affect | flavour | formation | for | example | flavour | may | be | controlled | by | applying | nonrecombinant | mutants | and/or | genetically | manipulated | recombinant | brewing | yeast | strains | the | potential | of | metabolic | engineering | using | genetic | tools | is | enormous | Brányik | et | al | 2008,10 | Betancur | et | al | 2020 | remarked | on | cultural | preferences | for | visual | appearance | in | particular | colour

The | present | study | relies | on | a | relatively | simplistic | and | practical | impact | of | the | ingredients | of | beer | on | its | flavour | for | example | water | can | add | mineral | and | metallic | flavours | to | the | beer | Barlow | Barlow | 2008 | Malted | barley | may | comprise | a | blend | of | the | following | malts | depending | on | its | style | of | beer | base | malts | kilned | or | colour | malts | crystal | or | caramel | malt | and/or | roasted | malt | Mosher | 2009 | The | sensory | vocabulary | associated | with | malt | includes | grainy | bready | caramel | toffee | nutty | roasted | coffee | chocolate | espresso | burnt | raisins

prunes | and | dried | fruit | Mosher | 2009 | Mosher | 2009

The | key | characteristics | of | beer | that | interact | with | food | are | intensity | of | flavour | body | acidity | hop | bitterness | maltiness | sweetness | fruitiness | carbonation | and | alcohol | content | cf | Morais | 2017 | Factors | that | might | be | considered | when | matching | food | with | beer | are | heaviness | body | light | dishes | work | well | with | delicate | beers | heavier | dishes | need | a | heavier | beer | and | flavour | intensity | the | more | intense | the | flavour | of | the | food | the | more | intense | the | flavour | of | the | beer

Also | the | cooking | methods | such | as | roasting | frying | grilling | and | smoking | can | increase | flavour | intensity | maltiness | often | complements | different | cooking | methods | hop | bitterness | roasted | malt | flavours | carbonisation | or | alcohol | content | can | balance | fattiness | whilst | and | sweetness | and | maltiness | may | complement | acidity | in | food | Brewers | Association | 2017

With | respect | to | sauces | other | accompaniments | and | seasoning | hop | bitterness | roasted | malt | alcohol | and | carbonation | balance | creamy | sauces | and | sweetness | for | example | a | light | herby | beer | could | complement | a | herbal | dish | whereas | a | sweet | malty | beer | could | accompany | a | spicy | sauce | Hop | bitterness | emphasises | heat | so | malty | or | sweet | beers | moderate | heat | and | spiciness

Additionally | sweetness | and | richness | complement | full | flavoured | beers | therefore | high | alcohol | beers | and | hop | bitterness | compliment | sweetness | stout | goes | well | with | dark | chocolate | and | the | acidity | in | fruit | beers | matches | fruit | tarts | and | fruity | creamy | desserts | cf | Brewers | Association | 2017 | Dorenburg | Page | 2006 | Morais | 2017 | It | is | easier | for | consumers | to | make | decisions | if | there | is | an | explanation | for | the | match | ideally | the | word | balance | should | accompany | the | recommendation | says | Block | 2012 | referring | not | only | to | the | food | and | the | beer | but | also | to | the | contrasting | flavours | Tab | 1 | summarises | Mosher | 's | 2009 | views | on | matching | food | with | selected | beers | Interestingly | more | recent | research | into | food | wine | and | food | beer | pairing | Eschevins | Giboreau | Julien | Dacremont | 2019 | determined | that | French | sommeliers | tended | to | follow | the | conceptual | associations | and | established | norms | as | did | the | wine | experts | however | the | beer | experts | relied | more | on | experiential | discourse | Following | a | critical | review | of | F&B | pairing | literature | Spence | 2020a | concluded | that | there | were | two | broad | approaches | to | the | pairing

cognitive | intellectual | and | perceptual | and | mooted | cultural | matches | were | a | subset | of | the | former | although | they | are | influenced | strongly | by | perceptually | pleasing | combinations | Spence | 2020b | expands | on | these | approaches | to | pairing

Destination | management | sense | of | place | and | the | Slow | Food | Movement

Taking | account | of | the | international | and | cultural | dimensions | it | became | clear | that | the | research | findings | would | have | implications | not | only | for | tourists | and | local | consumers | but | also | for | local | businesses | in | terms | of | destination | management | and | sense | of | place | Leiper | 1979 | identified | the | elements | of | the | tourism | system | as | tourists | generating | regions | transit | routes | and | destination | regions | which | comprise | the | tourist | industry | the | heart | of | the | system | He | maintained | that | within | this | open | system | these | elements | operated | within | physical | cultural | social | economic | and | political | environments | all | of | which | interacted | with | technology | and | had | both | spatial | and | functional | connections | Hence | he | perceived | a | destination | as | a | generating | area | or | transit | zone | within | the | context | of | a | wider | tourism | system | in | which | each | component | is | interrelated | and | has | a | strong | functional | reliance | on | the | others | In | terms | of | planning | and | development | the | predominant | focus | here | is | on | the | tourists | in | terms | of | their | origins | including | home | country | and | the | F&B | outlets | in | the | destination | or | region

Applying | these | concepts | to | the | present | study | the | notion | of | sense | of | place | in | the | context | of | destination | management | is | considered | to | be | appropriate | Destination | managers | and | local | tourism | stakeholders | need | to | project | a | positive | brand | image | to | attract | consumers | cf | Anholt | 2010 | Pike | Gentle | Kelly | Beatson | 2018 | UNWTO | 2009 | and | communicate | this | positive | image | and | reputation | to | residents | and | visitors | through | the | emotional | power | of | a | destination | 's | tone | including | not | only | its | ambiance | physical | fabric | and | character | but | also | the | attitude | of | its | people | its | heritage | and | narratives | in | short | a | destination | 's | sense | of | place | Morgan | Pritchard | Pride | 2011 | 12 | which | Anholt | 2009 | 30 | workshops | and | tasting | sessions | for | all | the | family | contributed | directly | to | revisit | intentions

In | conclusion | the | following | research | questions | are | posed

RQ1 | What | are | the | most | popular | food | and | beer | matchings

RQ2 | Are | there | any | cultural | differences | in | terms | of | preferred | food | and | beer | matchings

RQ3 | On | the | basis | of | the | findings | from | the | taste | panels | what | general | recommendations | for | matching | food | flavours | with | beer | styles | can | be | made

RQ4 | On | the | basis | of | the | findings | from | the | taste | panels | what | specific | menu | recommendations | can | be | made

RQ5 | On | the | basis | of | the | findings | from | the | taste | panels | what | practical | food | flavour | and | beer | style | matching | recommendations | can | be | made | to | assist | publicans | and | restaurateurs | RQ6 | What | might | be | the | impact | of | the | primary | research | findings | for | local | stakeholders | and | destination | managers

This | practical | qualitative | study | employed | evaluative | comparative | taste | testing | to | measure | target | consumers | likes | and | dislikes | it | is | time | and | cost | efficient | and | useful | for | product | positioning | and | competitive | benchmarking | and | to | determine | interactions | between | products | AROXA | 2018 | and | also | permits | comparisons | and | can | highlight | other | key | performance | indicators | of | food | or | drink | products | Kuhn | 2021 | The | target | consumers | may | be | referred | to | as | the | taste | panel | who | in | this | instance | have | the | collective | duty | to | taste | combinations | of | beer | and | selected | food | products | in | order | to | determine | factors | relating | to | their | combined | flavours | and | texture | In | some | instances | consumer | preference | taste | panels | are | large | and | untrained | standards | are | not | provided | and | decisions | are | based | on | preferences | alone | Bradley | 1953 | To | be | useful | panels | should | be | representative | of | the | consumer | market | of | interest | and | ideally | test | procedures | should | be | kept | simple | cf | Bradley | 1953

The | taste | panel | comprised | 214 | invited | seminar | participants | all | of | whom | were | employed | in | the | hospitality | tourism | sector | industry-59 | education-41 | predominantly | in | F&B | roles

The | tasting | sessions | took | place | in | eight | locations | across | six | CEE | countries | comprising | Bulgaria | n=40 | Czech | Republic | n=44 | Poland | n=19 | Romania | n=59 | Serbia | n=21 | and | Slovenia | n=31 | There | was | roughly | an | equal | number | of | males | and | females | aged | from | 20 | to | 64 | with | a | modal | age | group | of | 30 | 39

In | each | location | tasting | sessions | were | set | up | presented | and | conducted | identically

Following | the | recommended | procedures | prior | to | each | tasting | session | everyone | was | expected | to | wash | their | hands | In | each | location | the | test | samples | were | purchased | and | tasted | by | the | facilitator | in | advance | the | tasting | session | to | ensure | the | quality | standard | and | authenticity | of | each | of | the | products | and | to | create | a | positive | and | safe | taste | testing | environment | The | taste | panels | were | instructed | to | wait | to | taste | each | of | their | samples | until | they | had | been | given | the | background | information | and | told | to | start | tasting | cf | UCSD | Centre | for | Community | Health



An | introductory | lecture | was | given | to | raise | the | participants | awareness | of | factors | that | might | influence | the | character | of | beer | beer | characteristics | that | interact | with | food | and | issues | for | consideration | when | matching | food | with | beer | based | on | the | literature | Seven | generic | international | and | readily | available | and | contrasting | styles | of | beer | ale | lager | and | lambic | ranging | from | a | light | blonde | to | a | heavy | stout | were | chosen | for | the | present | research | The | beers | selected | were | sufficiently | different | to | elicit | different | matchings | cf | Eschevins | et | al | 2015

The | range | of | beers | provided | in | an | identical | sequence | in | each | location | They | included

Bohemian | pilsner | German | Hefeweizen | beer | Belgian | Witbier | Belgian | fruit | beer | IPA | Bitter

and | Stout | cf | Barlow | Barlow | 2008 | In | order | that | the | taste | buds | would | not | be | confused | by | flavour | combinations | the | foods | on | offer | were | simple | commonly | available | They | reflected | various | basic | taste | and | texture | sensations | suggested | by | the | literature | in | which | some | of | the | food | types | on | offer | had | been | linked | to | the | chosen | beer | styles | whilst | others | had | not | It | was | not | only | of | interest | to | identify | matches | that | worked | but | also | those | that | did | not | work | The | foods | for | tasting | alongside | the | beers | comprised | oily | fish | acidic | pickles | salty | hard | strongflavoured | cheese | high | protein | mild | and | spicy | meatballs | high | fat | sausage | and | sweet | dark | chocolate | The | beers | were | introduced | in | sequence | light | to | dark | and | small | bite | sized | portions | of | each | of | the | accompanying | foods | were | made | available | throughout | the | tasting | session | plus | water | and | bread | to | clear | the | palate | The | five | steps | in | taste | testing | were | followed

recognise | it | inspect | it | smell | it | taste | it | score | it | cf | UCSD | Centre | for | Community | Health | 2022 | Without | consultation | each | member | of | the | taste | panel | was | asked | to | record | his | her | individual | food | beer | preferences | matched | pairs | only | on | a | 6x7 | grid | Following | each | tasting | session | the | number | of | matches | in | each | square | of | the | grid | was | calculated | then | the | overall | totals | were | cumulated | and | compared | for | analytical | purposes

RQ1 | What | are | the | most | popular | food | and | beer | matchings

The | cumulated | findings | revealed | 3002 | out | of | 10,486 | possible | 28.6 | of | the | total | options | preferred | food | beer | matchings | indicating | that | there | was | no | clear | overall | consensus | Based | on | these | positive | responses | 12 | of | the | possible | 49 | matched | dyads | were | voted | for | by | over | 40 | of | the | tasters | Ref | Tab | 2 | suggesting | that | two | out | of | every | five | CEE | consumers | might | enjoy | matching | beers | of | the | style | similar | to | those | tasted | with | menu | items | incorporating | such | flavours | and | textures | as | the | foods | sampled | The | top | match | was | Belgian | fruit | beer | and | dark | chocolate | 63.7 | followed | not | very | closely | by | Bohemian | pilsner | 53.7 | then | Hefeweizen | beer | 53.3 | both | with | sausages | Strong | hard | cheese | was | matched | with | Witbier | and | Bohemian | pilsner | It | will | be | noted | that | to | some | extent | the | key | findings | confirm | a | number | of | general | and | more | specific | suggestions | for | pairing | and | matching | put | forward | by | Dorenburg | and | Page | 2006 | Morais | 2017 | and | Mosher | 2009

Interestingly | Donadini | Fumi | and | Lambri | 2013 | found | that | although | beer | preference | dominated | cheese | preference | cheese | flavour | dominance | over | beer | flavour | increased | pair | appreciation | Further | Donadini | Fumi | and | Newby | Clark | 2015 | maintained | that | familiarity | with | the | beers | enabled | more | profitable | exploitation | of | the | cheese | and | beer | pairing | in | terms | of | liking | and | sensory | properties

By | far | the | lowest | overall | percentages | matched | Belgian | fruit | beer | with | spicy | meatballs | 7.5 | and | Bohemian | pilsner | with | chocolate | 7.9 | Although | they | may | be | served | with | sausages | in | Germany | cheese | in | Switzerland | and | in | the | United | Kingdom | and | as | a | snack | or | side | dish | with | beer | in | some | CEE | countries | pickles | were | generally | not | favoured | as | an | accompaniment | to | beer | their | best | matches | were | with | Belgian | fruit | beer | 25.6 | and | Hefeweizen | 24.4

RQ2 | Are | there | any | cultural | differences | in | terms | of | preferred | food | and | beer | matchings

Turning | to | the | cultural | dimension | there | is | evidence | of | diversity | across | CEE | The | strongest | consensus | in | terms | of | the | food | beer | matchings | was | found | in | Poland | cf | Siemieniako | et | al | 2011 | whilst | the | most | disparate | opinions | emerged | from | Serbia | For | example | Belgian | fruit | beer | was | matched | with | dark | chocolate | by | over | two | thirds | of | the | tasters | in | every | country | except | Serbia | only | 23.8 | in | stark | contrast | every | taster | in | Poland | voter | for | this | matching | Therefore | it | is | important | to | consider | and | evaluate | the | cultural | dimension | when | tasting | food | and | beer | cf | Arellano | Covarrubias | et | al | 2019 | Prescott | 1998

RQ3 | On | the | basis | of | the | findings | from | the | taste | panels | what | general | recommendations | for | matching | food | flavours | and | beer | styles | can | be | made

Following | the | research | findings | Tab | 3 | offers | some | general | recommendations | for | food | and | beer | matches | ranked | according | to | popularity | pairing | beer | with | food | In | line | with | this | premise | it | is | advocated | that | perhaps | in | their | promotional | advertising | and | menus | food | outlets | might | consider | recommending | more | than | one | beer | to | accompany | each | food | item | possibly | offering | a | small | taste | so | that | the | consumer | may | make | an | informed | decision | according | to | his | /her | personal | preference | To | expand | the | findings | beyond | the | simple | foods | tasted | a | few | examples | of | possible | matches | consider | offering | options | as | or | within | tapas | nibbles | appetisers | starters | entrées | and/or | desserts | for | publicans | restaurateurs | and | consumers | are | suggested | in | Tab.4

Finally | in | order | to | take | a | practical | perspective | the | food | flavours | and | beer | styles | were | matched | as | shown | in | Fig | 1 | Based | on | the | research | findings | it | is | concluded | that | consumer | preferences | are | as | follows | Witbier | and/or | Hefeweizen | beer | should | be | served | with | salty | foods

Bitter | and/or | IPA | with | protein | foods | Fruit | beer | and/or | Stout | with | sweet | foods | and | Bohemian | pilsner | with | high | fat | foods | Publicans | and | restaurateurs | are | advised | to | take | heed | of | these | findings | in | making | recommendations | to | consumers | especially | in | CEE | Interestingly | the | tasters | did | not | appear | to | differentiate | between | the | heavier | bodied | more | complex | ales | and | the | light | crisp | lagers | when | matching | the | food | flavours | with | the | beer | styles | RQ5 | On | the | basis | of | the | findings | from | the | taste | panels | what | practical | food | flavour | and | beer | style | matching | recommendations | can | be | made | to | assist | publicans | and | restaurateurs

Figure | 1 | Overview | of | food | flavours | matched | with | beer | styles | RQ6 | What | might | be | the | impact | of | the | primary | research | findings | for | local | stakeholders | and | destination | managers | Leiper | 1979 | suggested | that | his | Tourism | System | could | be | used | by | managers | to | underpin | and | inform | their | operational | plans | In | order | to | promote | local | products | destination | managers | will | be | required | to | strengthen | their | stakeholder | engagement | and | understanding | Therefore | the | application | of | theoretical | models | such | as | Leiper | 's | 1979 | with | regard | to | supply | and | demand | i.e. | developing | an | understanding | of | the | motivations | and | desires | of | both | local | and | international | consumers | demand | and | the | ability | of | host | community | to | deliver | supply | is | recommended

Additionally | business | managers | are | advised | to | employ | a | positive | brand | image | to | develop | sense | of | place | toolkits | cf | Jarratt | et | al | 2019 | with | stakeholders | supply | to | encourage | greater | ownership | of | local | culture | produce | and | identity | all | of | which | could | lead | to | enhanced | and | sustainable | visitor | and | host | community | experiences | Subsequently | destination | managers | would | then | be | in | a | position | to | inform | local | business | owners | in | terms | of | future | marketing | and | promotion

Destination | Management | considerations | include | liaison | with | local | stakeholders | to | develop | a | unique | sense | of | place | toolkit | See | Jarratt | et | al | 2019 | then | employing | the | kit | in | conjunction | with | the | above | research | findings | to | inform | targeted | marketing | messages | that | are | aligned | with | consumer | preferences | so | reinforcing | the | local | heritage | and | vernacular | through | the | promotion | of | local | produce | The | F&B | offerings | could | be | enhanced | further | by | providing | micro | and | craft | brewers | opportunities | to | compete | with | conglomerate | brands | so | underpinning | sense | of | place | and | helping | to | drive | visitors | to | less | well | known | areas | that | have | capacity | to | relieve | pressure | on | hotspots | In | this | way | current | consumer | demands | for | new | authentic | experiences | can | be | met | whilst | addressing | any | unintended | impacts | of | Overtourism

As | noted | at | the | outset | due | to | recent | research | into | the | impact | of | obesity | and | alcohol | on | health | plus | the | tightening | of | the | drink | drive | laws | in | most | European | countries | many | modern | consumers | do | not | want | to | drink | beer | alone | Based | on | the | above | findings | various | options | are | open | to | publicans | restaurateurs | especially | to | attract | both | national | and | international | tourists | If | the | consumer | desires | only | to | snack | whilst | drinking | suggested | matches | on | a | table | or | bar | menu | might | be | in | the | form | of | small | bites | or | tapas | It | is | recommended | that | the | styles | of | beer | on | offer | are | listed | alongside | the | food | offerings | but | with | possible | matches | as | opposed | to | direct | pairings | or | with | suggestions | of | three | to | four | options | with | appropriate | taste | and | flavour | descriptions | In | this | way | consumers | initial | choices | may | be | beers | or | dishes | and | if | necessary | verbal | recommendations | may | be | sought | from | the | host | service | provider/ | beer | sommelier | Robinson | Clifford | 2012 | purported | that | a | focus | on | the | quality | of | service | provision | could | be | separated | from | F&B | as | it | can | offer | positive | experiences | which | can | enhance | revisit | intentions | They | suggested | that | interactive | F&B | matching | could | be | linked | to | historical | and/or | cultural | contexts

In | addition | interactive | terminals | and | simulators | can | be | available | on | site | to | aid | visitors | understanding | of | how | local | raw | food | materials | were | produced | using | sustainable | methods | cf

Jung | Ineson | Kim | Yap | 2015

One | interesting | possibility | which | offers | the | guest | flexibility | and | variability | is | to | set | a | fixed | price | for | two | three | four | or | five | beers | and | a | corresponding | number | of | dishes | served | alongside | one | another | on | a | suitable | wood | slice | tray | or | platter | The | beer | should | be | served | in | a | choice | of | 250 | 400 | or | 500 | ml | measures | with | the | portion | size | and | type | of | glass | See | Fig | 2 | for | examples | being | selected | according | to | the | style | of | beer | local | tradition | and | the | order | of | each | consumer | In | general | the | variety | of | local | CEE | beers | especially | from | small | producers | is | increasing

Additionally | due | to | the | need | to | reduce | food | and | drink | miles | so | promoting | sustainable | tourism | local | and | in | town | producers | are | offering | Slow | Food | accompaniments | to | their | beer | products | which | also | may | be | brewed | locally

It | was | pointed | out | that | the | LA | County | health | regulations | associated | with | COVID | 19 | have | made | tasting | rooms | unsustainable | leading | possibly | to | the | closure | of | some | breweries | Madler | 2020 | On | the | other | side | of | the | pond | a | United | Kingdom | couple | have | found | a | novel | solution | to | the | problem | of | pub | closures | Eastern | Daily | Press | 2020 | They | offer | virtual | brewery | tours | during | which | users | visit | from | remote | locations | via | the | internet | and | the | virtual | visitors | may | ask | live | questions | followed | by | a | beer | tasting | with | the | beers | that | have | been | delivered | to | the | tasters | homes | These | virtual | tours | may | be | bought | as | family | gifts | so | that | families | and | friends | often | separated | by | COVID | regulations | and | lockdown | may | reunite | to | taste | and | drink | beer | together

Clearly | even | after | COVID | restrictions | are | lifted | this | innovative | idea | could | be | extended | to | include | food | and | beer | matching | In | this | context | another | suggestion | that | reflects | not | only | the | consumers | concerns | about | the | drink | drive | laws | but | also | healthy | eating | is | associated | with | the | recent | growth | in | the | consumption | of | non | low | alcoholic | beverages | that | can | provide | microbrewers | with | opportunities | to | support | food | outlets | or | to | offer | beer | and | food | matching | on | site

This | study | has | a | few | limitations | worth | noting | in | particular | the | biased | sampling | taste | panels | comprising | educators | and | local | industrialists | as | opposed | to | visitors | is | likely | to | impact | the | external | validity | of | the | findings | In | order | to | improve | the | representativeness | of | this | study | future | research | should | focus | on | discrete | locations | and | ensure | proportional | representation | from | locals | and | tourists | As | certain | features | may | be | associated | with | food | and | beer | matching | preferences | such | as | country | of | origin | gender | and | age | it | would | be | interesting | also | to | profile | the | consumers | including | their | contextual | and | environmental | influences | such | as | food | and | beer | drinking | habits | and | preferences | via | a | brief | survey | prior | to | or | during | the | F&B | tasting

Although | the | present | study | has | developed | a | simple | model | appropriate | to | the | limited | data | it | lacks | the | qualitative | depth | to | understand | the | reasons | behind | the | matching | preferences | Future | researchers | and | F&B | managers | are | advised | to | question | consumers | to | determine | the | reasons | behind | their | beer | and | food | preferences | Furthermore | the | validity | of | the | developed | here | could | be | tested | and | extended | within | a | different | cultural | context | for | example | in | a | Western | European | country | America | or | Asia | using | larger | location | specific | sample | size | to | confirm | or | refute | the | generalisability | of | the | findings

As | the | types | of | beer | on | offer | increase | especially | with | the | development | of | craft | local | and | low | alcohol | beers | and | the | fact | that | microbreweries | are | offering | food | accompaniments | to | their | products | research | into | food | and | beer | matching | is | of | practical | value | in | inspiring | not | only | consumers | but | also | producers | and | hospitality | and | tourism | vendors | to | be | even | more | sustainable | Furthermore | if | we | consider | the | trends | related | to | enjoying | alcohol | with | food | as | opposed | to | alcohol | per | se | visitors | should | be | encouraged | to | sample | the | matchings | preferred | by | the | local | people | cf | Betancur | et | al | 2020 | in | the | EU | employ | over | 97 | million | people | and | their | average | contribution | to | the | EU | budget | is | 56 | SMEs | play | an | integral | role | in | economic | growth | regional | development | job | creation | and | innovation | The | literature | identifies | different | size | categories | of | small | and | medium | enterprises | including | micro | enterprises | up | to | 10 | employees | small | enterprises | up | to | 50 | employees | and | medium | enterprises | up | to | 250 | employees | There | are | also | categories | characterized | by | the | uniform | type | of | production | i.e. | brewing | Hall | et | al | 2004 | Psillaki | Dasaklakis | 2009 | Jõeveer | 2013 | Moritz | et | al | 2016 | Kenourgios | et | al | 2019 | Due | to | their | size | all | the | stated | SME | categories | face | many | major | limitations | across | the | industries | in | which | they | deliver | their | activities | This | also | includes | missing | internal | skills | such | as | marketing | or | marketing | communication | skills | Beck | Demirguc | Kunt | 2006 | European | Commission | 2007 | Beck | et | al | 2008 | Palacín | Sánchez | et | al | 2013 | European | Central | Bank | 2014 | Kumar | Rao | 2015 | Baños | Caballero | et | al | 2016 | Kersten | et | al | 2017 | Thus | support | of | adequate | digital | skills | and | activities | related | to | e | commerce | is | vital | to | foster | the | competitiveness | of | SMEs | Parliament | of | the | Czech | Republic | 2020 | Nica | et | al | 2019 | Special | attention | is | paid | to | skills | and | knowledge | related | to | digital | tools | Millman | El | Gohary | 2011 | such | as | online | marketing

On | the | other | hand | some | microbreweries | follow | a | different | strategy | building | their | marketing | communication | on | specific | manufacturing | processes | unique | ingredients | or | innovations | in | production | Cabras | Bamforth | 2016 | As | consumers | tend | to | prefer | and | appraise | local | and | unique | experiences | microbreweries | are | facing | a | growing | interest | Pokrivčák | et | al | 2019 | Tremblay | et | al | 2005 | Král | et | al | 2020 | Pícha | et | al | 2018 | Such | customers | usually | prefer | products | with | more | flavor | and | personality | like | to | experiment | appreciate | the | craftsmanship | behind | the | products | and | care | about | where | their | food | and | drink | come | from | Savov | Szarková | 2022 | Brown | 2020

The | so | called | craft | revolution | has | also | hit | the | Czech | Republic | and | since | 2010 | there | has | been | a | significant | increase | in | this | group | of | SMEs | At | the | moment | there | are | 480 | craft | breweries | in | the | Czech | Republic | Concerning | this | dynamic | evolution | number | of | microbreweries | established | and | growing | competition | pressure | the | use | and | correct | timing | application | of | marketing | communication | is | becoming | of | strategic | importance | Eze | et | al | 2020

Microbreweries | in | the | Czech | Republic | currently | use | a | broad | portfolio | of | marketing | tools | to | communicate | with | their | environment | customers | supporters | and | other | stakeholder | groups

These | tools | can | be | identified | through | the | websites | of | the | individual | breweries | mass | media | e.g. | radio | TV | and | other | public | media | -if | a | microbrewery | advertises | there | or | collaborates | with | the | media | in | another | form | such | as | via | story | coverage | etc | public | documents | e.g. | Brewing | calendar | -Frantík | 2019 | and | statements | e.g. | Research | Institute | of | Brewing | and | Malting | 2020 | social | media | most | microbreweries | using | social | media | in | the | Czech | Republic | use | Facebook | and | Instagram | etc

Despite | sketchy | reports | and | studies | the | microbrewery | phenomenon | is | still | somewhat | unknown | and | practically | undocumented | scientific | literature | on | the | broader | scale | is | absent

This | may | also | result | from | the | fact | that | the | actual | subjects | micro | enterprises | have | not | been | sufficiently | studied | so | far | Gherhes | et | al | 2016

The | neolocalism | phenomenon | linked | to | microbreweries | constitutes | a | major | discussion | stream | in | the | academic | literature | Ikäheimo | 2021 | Holtkamp | et | al | 2016 | Neolocalism | expressed | through | the | brand | related | narrative | is | why | microbreweries | have | recently | been | recalled | as | place | based | brands | Taylor | Jr. | DiPietro | 2020 | Debies | Carl | 2019 | Eberts | 2014

Microbreweries | intensify | their | local | image | through | connection | to | the | local | place | Melewar | Skinner | 2020 | Schnell | Reese | 2014 | and | emphasize | their | local | identity | through | the | marketing | strategy | Eades | et | al | 2017 | Murray | Kline | 2015 | Microbreweries | admit | that | by | highlighting | the | local | attributes | for | their | marketing | communication | they | can | foster | closeness | with | customers | Taylor | Jr. | DiPietro | 2020 | Hede | Watne | 2013 | Schnell | Reese | 2003 | Pícha | Skořepa | 2018 | This | is | reflected | in | company | and | beer | names | beer | labels | and | other | imagery | and | narratives | linking | the | products | Sjölander | Lindqvist | et | al | 2019 | Fletchall | 2016

Location | place | and | social | ties | play | an | important | role | in | craft | brewing | as | it | often | becomes | a | critical | part | of | the | brewery | 's | identity | Reid | Gatrell | 2017 | Microbreweries | significantly | benefit | from | location | related | aspects | in | terms | of | increased | incoming | traffic | from | local | customers | as | well | as | visitors | looking | for | a | specific | and | unique | beer | experience | Nilsson | et | al | 2018 | In | terms | of | promotion | the | location | of | the | sales | point | is | important | Donadini | Porretta | 2017 | Thus | based | on | the | cited | literature | we | have | formulated | the | research | question | RQ1 | whether | the | existence | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | affects | the | marketing | communication | of | the | microbrewery

Moreover | according | to | Březinová | et | al | 2019 | Jones | 2017 | and | Withers | 2017 | the | place | of | the | sales | point | Ikäheimo | 2021 | Cresswell | 2009 | a | sales | point | may | come | in | different | forms | such | as | a | restaurant | pub | street | vending | point | gift | shop | etc | affects | the | composition | of | the | marketing | mix | The | selection | of | marketing | tools | is | guided | by | the | place | The | tools | of | the | marketing | communication | mix | that | microbreweries | use | in | connection | with | the | local | identity | and | relation | to | place | Moore | et | al | 2016 | support | their | unique | character | Schnell | Reese | 2014 | This | is | further | emphasized | by | the | actual | location | of | the | sales | point | if | a | microenterprise | has | it | in | the | center | vs. | on | the | outskirts | Sales | points | in | the | centre | do | not | have | to | use | as | many | marketing | communication | tools | as | posters | or | printed | media | ads

On | the | other | hand | those | on | the | outskirts | must | focus | more | on | events | to | generate | incoming | traffic | which | comprises | fewer | random | passers | by | that | appear | in | the | center | i.e. | they | organize | more | events | tastings | and | excursions | Equally | microbreweries | operating | sales | points | outside | the | center | use | more | online | tools | as | the | sale | point | is | less | visible | awareness | Therefore | based | on | the | cited | literature | we | have | formulated | the | research | question | RQ2 | whether | the | location | of | the | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | affects | the | marketing | communication | of | that | microbrewery

This | paper | aims | to | fill | in | the | missing | knowledge | on | the | marketing | communication | of | microbreweries | in | the | Czech | Republic | The | analysis | pays | special | attention | to | the | phenomenon | of | neolocalism | particularly | the | place | factor | Ikäheimo | 2021 | By | outlining | the | substantial | growth | of | literature | discussing | the | role | of | neolocalism | in | the | craft | beer | industry | this | study | contributes | to | a | better | understanding | of | how | neolocalism | affects | the | choice | of | marketing | communication | mix | tools

For | this | research | we | defined | marketing | communication | as | components | of | the | marketing | communication | mix | The | studied | components | were | pre | selected | upon | a | preliminary | test | with | a | limited | group | of | microbreweries | whose | representatives | indicated | these | tools | as | the | most | frequently | used | ones | The | analyzed | marketing | tools | 23 | in | total | are | the | following | labels | coasters | tablecloths | glasses | signboards | free | tastings | paid | tastings | limited | discounts | excursions | to | own | brewing | facilities | competitions | participation | in | beer | competitions | reference | of | existing | customers | own | website | sponsoring | of | local | groups | and | charities | organizing | of | cultural | events | social | media | advertising | in | printed | media | regional | newspapers | magazines | advertising | in | radio | regional | stations | advertising | in | printed | media | newspapers | magazines | advertising | in | radio | advertising | banners | on | the | internet | posters | billboards | websites | of | other | subjects | e.g. | municipalities | The | use | of | a | specific | marketing | tool | is | captured | as | a | binary | variable | use | 1 | do | n't | use | 0 | At | the | same | time | the | tools | were | categorized | by | their | character | to | ATL | Above | The | Line | BTL | Below | The | Line | and | ON | LINE | vs. | OFF | LINE | see | Annex | 1 | The | categorization | of | marketing | tools | for | the | ATL | BTL | group | was | based | on | an | evaluation | of | three | marketing | experts | two | scholars | one | from | business

The | location | of | the | direct | sales | point | has | been | operationalized | as | a | nominal | variable | in | the | center | on | the | outskirts | outside | the | municipality | The | direct | sales | point | has | also | been | of | binary | character | no | own | sales | point | 0 | own | sales | point | 1

With | regards | to | the | research | questions | we | have | formulated | the | following | research | hypotheses

H1 | The | existence | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | affects | the | composition | of | the | marketing | communication | mix

The | location | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | affects | the | composition | of | the | marketing | communication | mix

To | test | the | relationship | between | the | variables | we | used | the | Pearson | χ2 | independence | test

Before | each | analysis | we | always | checked | if | the | prerequisites | for | the | used | method | have | been | met | i.e. | the | contingency | table | does | not | have | more | than | 20 | cells | with | an | expected | theoretical | value | below | 5 | and | at | the | same | time | that | the | expected | value | in | either | of | the | cells | is | below | 2 | This | prerequisite | has | been | met | in | all | of | the | analyses | delivered | An | exception | was | that | of | analyses | performed | with | the | variable | marketing | tool | of | advertising | in | nationwide | printed | media | and | advertising | in | national | radio | stations | where | the | frequencies | were | very | low | and | were | therefore | excluded | from | the | set | of | the | assessed | marketing | tools

An | analogical | method | had | also | been | defined | for | testing | the | in | In | this | case | the | specific | formulation | of | the | hypotheses | is | the | following

H3 | The | existence | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | affects | the | use | of | ATL | vs. | BTL | tools

The | existence | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | affects | the | use | of | ON | LINE | vs. | OFF | LINE | tools

The | location | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | affects | the | use | of | ATL | vs. | BTL | tools

The | location | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | affects | the | use | of | ON | LINE | vs. | OFF | LINE | tools

It | is | important | to | highlight | that | the | presented | analyses | included | the | assessment | of | the | frequency | of | use | of | the | individual | marketing | tools | in | the | addressed | microbreweries | not | the | expenditures | on | these | tools

Questionnaires | were | electronically | distributed | across | the | entire | population | all | microbreweries | in | the | Czech | Republic | in | three | rounds | The | first | round | occurred | in | January | 2017 | the | second | in | May | 2017 | and | the | last | in | January | 2018 | The | research | team | strived | for | the | highest | possible | response | rate | which | had | been | 21 | after | the | first | round | 35 | after | the | second | round | and | 44 | after | the | third | round | In | each | of | the | additional | rounds | of | the | data | collection | only | those | microbreweries | had | been | addressed | that | did | not | respond | in | the | first | or | the | second | round | or | microbreweries | that | had | been | recently | established | The | response | rate | after | the | third | round | had | been | evaluated | as | sufficient | or | as | the | maximum | possible | Out | of | the | total | number | of | 374 | microbreweries | data | as | of | 30 | January | 2018 | 165 | questionnaires | had | been | collected | Four | questionnaires | had | been | discarded | from | the | data | set | due | to | being | incomplete | The | remaining | 161 | microbreweries | therefore | represent | the | studied | sample | which | accounts | for | 43 | of | all | microbreweries | in | the | Czech | Republic

The | existence | of | a | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | significantly | affects | the | use | of | the | following | marketing | tools

1 | Organizing | of | cultural | events | microbreweries | without | a | direct | sales | point | organize | significantly | less | events | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 10 | -6 | χ | 2 | 33.8 | df | 1 | 2 | Advertising | -regional | printed | media | microbreweries | without | a | direct | sales | point | advertise | significantly | less | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.0005 | χ | 2 | 12.3 | df | 1 | 3 | Posters | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | post | significantly | more | posters | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.000004 | χ | 2 | 21.3 | df | 1 | 4 | Competitions | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | participate | in | significantly | more | competitions | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.0008 | χ | 2 | 11.2 | df | 1 | 5 | Tablecloths | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | use | tablecloths | significantly | more | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.00008 | χ | 2 | 15.5 | df | 1 | 6 | Signboards | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | use | signboards | significantly | more | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 10 | -6 | χ | 2 | 64.2 | df | 1 | 7 | Tastings | -paid | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | run | significantly | more | tastings | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.03 | χ | 2 | 4.6 | df | 1 | 8 | Excursions | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | run | significantly | more | excursions | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.005 | χ | 2 | 7.8 | df | 1 | 9 | Websites | microbreweries | without | a | direct | sales | point | use | them | significantly | more | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.004 | χ | 2 | 8.3 | df | 1 | 10 | Sponsoring | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | sponsor | significantly | more | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.01 | χ | 2 | 6.1 | df | 1 | 11 | Advertising | -regional | radio | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | use | it | significantly | more | than | the | expected | frequency | t | -p | 0.0005 | χ | 2 | 12.1 | df | 1 | 12 | Banners | microbreweries | with | a | direct | sales | point | use | them | significantly | more | than | the | expected | frequency | -p | 0.049 | χ | 2 | 3.9 | df | 1

The | results | therefore | confirm | hypothesis | H1 | that | the | existence | of | a | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | does | affect | the | composition | of | the | marketing | communication | mix

Microbreweries | with | or | without | direct | sales | points | use | BTL | tools | less | frequently | than | ATL | tools | because | there | are | more | of | them | in | the | sample | However | the | analysis | also | showed | that | the | ratio | of | using | ATL | to | BTL | is | higher | in | microbreweries | with | direct | sales | points | whereas | microbreweries | without | direct | sales | points | demonstrate | a | lower | ratio | This | means | microbreweries | with | direct | sales | points | prefer | ATL | tools | whereas | microbreweries | without | direct | sales | points | tend | to | use | BTL | tools | In | other | words | microbreweries | with | direct | sales | points | use | significantly | more | ATL | tools | compared | to | the | expected | frequencies | whereas | in | microbreweries | without | direct | sales | points | the | situation | is | the | opposite | The | existence | of | a | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | significantly | affects | p | 0.00004 | χ2 | 16.9 | df | 1 | the | use | of | ATL | vs. | BTL | tools | The | results | confirm | the | hypothesis | H3 | that | the | existence | of | a | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | does | affect | the | use | of | ATL | vs. | BTL | tools

Microbreweries | with | direct | and | without | direct | sales | points | use | OFF | LINE | tools | more | often | than | ON | LINE | tools | as | there | are | also | more | of | them | in | the | sample | However | the | analysis | also | showed | that | the | ratio | of | using | ON | LINE | to | OFF | LINE | tools | is | significantly | higher | in | microbreweries | without | direct | sales | points | In | other | words | microbreweries | without | direct | sales | points | prefer | ON | LINE | tools | because | some | OFF | LINE | tools | can | not | be | used | at | all | or | with | some | difficulties | only | e.g. | the | tablecloths | The | existence | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | points | significantly | affects | p | 0.0009 | χ | 2 | 11 | df | 1 | the | use | of | ON | LINE | vs. | OFF | LINE | tools | The | results | confirm | hypothesis | H4 | that | the | existence | of | a | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | does | affect | the | use | of | ON | LINE | vs. | OFF | LINE | tools

Location | of | the | direct | sales | point | outside | x | outskirts | x | centre | also | significantly | affects | the | use | of | the | following | marketing | tools

1 | Advertising | -regional | printed | media | microbreweries | in | the | center | advertise | significantly | less | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | on | the | outskirts | advertise | significantly | more | -p | 0.002 | χ | 2 | 12.9 | df | 2 | 2 | Posters | microbreweries | in | the | center | post | significantly | less | posters | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | on | the | outskirts | significantly | more | -p | 0.03 | χ | 2 | 6.8 | df | 2 | 3 | Competitions | microbreweries | in | the | center | participate | in | significantly | less | competitions | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | on | the | outskirts | participate | significantly | more | -p | 0.00007 | χ | 2 | 19.2 | df | 2 | microbreweries | in | the | center | use | significantly | less | of | this | tool | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | outside | municipalities | do | so | significantly | more | -p | 0.003 | χ | 2 | 11,9 | df | 2 | 4 | Tastings | -unpaid | microbreweries | in | the | center | run | significantly | less | of | them | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | outside | municipalities | do | so | significantly | more | -p | 0.002 | χ | 2 | 12.8 | df | 2 | 5 | Tastings | -paid | microbreweries | in | the | center | run | significantly | less | of | them | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | outside | municipalities | do | so | significantly | more | -p | 0.00001 | χ | 2 | 22.7 | df | 2 | 6 | Excursions | microbreweries | in | the | center | organize | significantly | less | of | them | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | outside | municipalities | do | so | more | -p | 0.008 | χ | 2 | 9,6 | df | 2 | 7 | Websites | microbreweries | on | the | outskirts | use | them | more | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | outside | municipalities | do | so | significantly | less | -p | 0.006 | χ | 2 | 10.2 | df | 2 | 8 | Advertising | -regional | radio | microbreweries | outside | municipalities | use | significantly | more | of | it | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | on | the | outskirts | use | significantly | less | advertising | -p | 0.0007 | χ | 2 | 14.6 | df | 2 | 9 | Banners | microbreweries | in | the | center | use | them | significantly | more | than | the | expected | frequency | on | the | other | hand | microbreweries | on | the | outskirts | use | them | significantly | less | -p | 0.001 | χ | 2 | 13.4 | df | 2

The | results | therefore | confirm | hypothesis | H2 | that | the | location | of | the | direct | sales | point | does | affect | the | composition | of | the | marketing | communication | mix

A | further | part | of | the | analysis | focused | on | finding | out | whether | the | location | of | the | direct | sales | point | affects | the | use | of | ATL | vs. | BTL | tools | It | can | not | be | proved | that | the | direct | sales | point | location | significantly | affects | p | 0.46 | χ2 | 1.54 | df | 2 | the | use | of | ATL | vs. | BTL | tools | The | results | therefore | do | not | confirm | the | hypothesis | H5 | that | the | existence | of | a | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | affects | the | use | of | ATL | vs. | BTL | tools

Regardless | of | their | direct | sales | point | location | microbreweries | more | frequently | use | OFF | LINE | than | ON | LINE | tools | as | there | are | also | more | of | them | However | the | analysis | has | shown | that | the | ratio | of | using | ON | LINE | to | OFF | LINE | is | significantly | higher | in | microbreweries | in | the | center | In | other | words | microbreweries | in | the | center | use | significantly | more | often | the | ON | LINE | tools | compared | to | the | expected | frequencies | whereas | in | microbreweries | on | the | outskirts | and | outside | municipalities | it | is | the | opposite | situation | Direct | sales | point | location | significantly | affects | p | 0.01 | χ | 2 | 9.2 | df | 2 | the | use | of | the | ON | LINE | vs. | OFF | LINE | tools | The | results | therefore | confirm | hypothesis | H6 | that | the | existence | of | a | microbrewery | direct | sales | point | does | affect | the | use | of | the | ON | LINE | vs. | OFF | LINE | tools

An | overview | table | of | the | summarized | results | is | part | of | Tab | 1 | Marketing | tools | are | shown | according | to | research | questions | RQ1 | and | RQ2

Affected | by | the | existence | of | microbrewery | direct | sales | point

Affected | by | the | location | of | the | direct | sales | point

Neolocalism | is | a | strategy | when | microbreweries | try | to | emphasize | their | connection | to | the | location | through | invoking | geography | and | place | in | their | communication | strategies | Eberts | 2014 | The | purpose | of | our | study | was | to | identify | how | the | existence | of | microbrewery | direct | sales | points | affects | the | composition | of | the | marketing | communication | mix | RQ1 | As | per | the | use | of | specific | tools | the | existence | of | a | microbrewery | 's | direct | sales | point | leads | to | higher | use | of | the | marketing | communication | mix | tools | connected | with | the | given | location | use | of | neolocalism | elements | such | as | tastings | competitions | which | may | come | with | a | regional | outreach | or | excursions | At | the | same | time | it | leads | to | higher | use | of | tools | such | as | sponsoring | In | the | next | part | of | the | analysis | we | focused | on | microbreweries | with | a | local | direct | sales | point | We | studied | how | the | location | of | this | direct | sales | point | affects | the | composition | of | the | marketing | communication | mix | RQ2 | Microbreweries | with | direct | sales | points | in | the | center | advertise | less | in | the | regional | printed | media | use | less | posters | and | also | use | less | tools | such | as | competitions | tastings | or | excursions | than | microbreweries | with | their | direct | sales | points | on | the | outskirts | or | outside | municipalities | H2 | However | the | location | of | a | direct | sales | point | does | not | affect | the | composition | of | the | marketing | communication | mix | in | terms | of | the | ratio | of | ATL | BTL | communication | tools | used | H5 | On | the | other | hand | microbreweries | having | a | direct | sales | point | in | the | center | use | more | banners | or | advertising | on | local | radio | stations | they | also | use | more | ON | LINE | marketing | communication | tools | H6 | Our | results | support | Donadini | Porretta | 2017 | who | state | that | the | location | of | a | direct | sales | point | is | significant | in | terms | of | promotion

Communication | strategy | is | affected | by | the | way | of | connection | to | the | location | that | is | whether | a | microbrewery | does | or | does | not | have | a | direct | sales | point | or | where | this | direct | sales | point | is | located | with | regards | to | the | physical | situation | within | the | municipality | or | place | Jones | 2017 | Withers | 2017 | Moore | et | al | 2016 | Regarding | neolocalism | microbreweries | use | various | marketing | communication | tools | and | choose | different | communication | strategies | based | on | their | physical | presence | in | the | local | context

The | term | diaspora | is | actually | associated | with | the | dispersal | of | the | Jews | by | leaving | their | lands | but | over | time | it | has | also | begun | to | be | used | to | express | immigrants | who | left | their | homeland | and | started | to | live | in | other | countries | Pande | 2018 | Migrants | visits | to | the | homeland | were | not | very | frequent | in | the | past | Basch | et | al | 1994 | However | this | situation | has | disappeared | thanks | to | the | developments | in | transportation | technologies | Li | 2020 | Migrants | who | are | financially | eligible | and | have | no | obstacle | to | travel | to | the | homeland | have | gained | momentum | in | their | travels | to | the | homeland | At | the | same | time | thanks | to | the | developments | in | communication | technologies | the | attachments | between | the | migrants | and | their | relatives | were | strengthened | and | this | was | one | of | the | factors | that | triggered | their | travels | to | the | homeland | Cıkı | Kızanlıklı | 2021

These | touristic | trips | of | migrants | to | their | homeland | have | been | studied | by | researchers | under | various | titles | especially | diaspora | tourism | Huang | et | al | 2016 | homeland | tourism | visiting | friends | and | relatives | tourism | ancestral | tourism | roots | tourism | ethnic | tourism | homesick | tourism | genealogy | tourism | etc | Diaspora | tourism | can | be | shown | as | the | most | popular | among | the | studies | on | the | touristic | homeland | travels | of | migrants | and | diaspora | tourism | studies | are | Ciki | K.D. | examined | in | this | study | Diaspora | tourism | can | be | briefly | defined | as | tourism | movements | produced | consumed | and | experienced | by | immigrants | and | these | travels | can | have | various | purposes | Coles | Timothy | 2004 | As | summarized | by | Huang | et | al | 2018 | previous | studies | revealed | that | immigrants | visit | their | homeland | for | various | reasons | such | as | leisure | time | genealogy | roots | seeking | sharing | family | traditions | with | their | children | visiting | relatives | and | friends | religion | pilgrimage | language | learning | business | and | cultural | events

It | is | possible | to | say | that | diaspora | tourism | has | various | advantages | Although | there | is | a | lack | of | work | it | is | known | that | diaspora | tourism | is | not | as | seasonal | as | other | types | of | tourism | so | tourism | spreads | throughout | the | year | and | can | create | employment | opportunities | Pelliccia | 2016 | Diaspora | tourism | provides | an | alternative | source | of | income | for | countries | and | diaspora | members | are | assumed | to | promote | their | homeland | in | host | countries | Newland | 2011 | Diaspora | tourists | do | not | spend | as | much | money | as | foreign | tourists | but | they | make | significant | economic | contributions | to | local | businesses | and | can | help | new | unknown | destinations | enter | the | international | tourism | market | Vong | et | al | 2017 | Countries | get | foreign | exchange | flow | thanks | to | diaspora | tourism | and | moreover | thanks | to | these | travels | migrants | can | be | motivated | to | invest | directly | in | their | homeland | Newland | Taylor | 2010 | Also | travels | to | the | homeland | of | migrants | can | help | to | preserve | their | cultural | identity | and | these | travels | can | improve | the | attachment | between | their | homeland | and | immigrants | Huang | et | al | 2013

Considering | that | approximately | 281 | million | people | are | international | migrants | in | 2020 | it | can | be | said | that | diaspora | tourism | is | an | important | tourism | market | IOM | 2021 | While | the | number | of | immigrants | around | the | world | is | increasing | day | by | day | the | travels | of | diaspora | communities | to | the | homeland | are | also | gaining | momentum | Alexander | et | al | 2017

Researchers | interest | in | these | movements | also | increases | directly | proportionally | Studies | on | the | homeland | travels | of | diaspora | communities | have | begun | to | attract | the | attention | of | researchers | especially | since | the | 2000s | and | many | studies | have | been | conducted | on | diaspora | tourism

There | are | many | studies | on | diaspora | tourism | but | no | bibliometric | study | has | been | found | In | this | context | the | current | study | aims | to | examine | the | diaspora | tourism | studies | in | the | WoS | database | from | 2000 | to | 2021 | Bibliometric | analysis | is | used | in | various | research | fields | because | it | is | an | effective | way | to | analyze | a | particular | subject | a | particular | journal | Shang | et | al | 2015

Many | bibliometric | studies | have | been | carried | out | within | the | scope | of | tourism | studies | Mavric | et | al | 2020 | Researchers | publish | studies | through | bibliometric | analysis | to | facilitate | assessment | and | monitoring | of | subject | development | using | advanced | software | programs | when | their | interests | reach | a | certain | level | of | saturation | Koseoglu | 2016 | Bibliometric | analysis | has | a | combination | of | statistics | information | science | and | philology | in | a | particular | field | and | provides | Ciki | K.D. | a | better | explanation | of | the | development | of | a | particular | research | direction | using | bibliometric | indicators | Mulet | Forteza | et | al | 2019

The | research | consists | of | four | sections | apart | from | the | introduction | The | introduction | section | is | followed | by | literature | review | and | methodological | procedures | and | results | sections | And | finally | the | conclusions | are | presented

Diaspora | tourism | includes | travel | to | places | where | migrants | were | born | raised | or | where | their | ancestors | lived | or | continue | to | live | These | travels | are | based | on | reasons | such | as | satisfying | the | longing | for | relatives | friends | and | homeland | seeking | roots | family | gatherings | and | protecting | their | identity | Bandyopadhyay | 2008 | Kaftanoglu | Timothy | 2013 | Huang | et | al | 2018 | The | above | can | be | shown | among | the | main | travel | motivations | of | diasporic | tourists | However | it | has | been | revealed | in | some | studies | that | diasporas | consume | tourism | activities | that | diasporic | tourists | consume | during | their | homeland | travels | combined | with | leisure | time | activities | Cıkı | Kızanlıklı | 2021 | Newland | Taylor | 2010

Each | diaspora | community | has | a | different | migration | history | civil | war | terrorism | religious | oppression | education | better | income | geographical | difficulties | etc | and | has | its | own | unique | cultural | identity | In | addition | the | travels | of | diaspora | communities | to | the | homeland | can | be | affected | by | generational | and | origin | differences | economic | and | other | conditions | of | the | homeland | geographical | location | and | various | similar | reasons | Huang | Chen | 2020 | It | can | be | said | that | migrants | generally | need | to | visit | their | homeland | but | due | to | the | reasons | mentioned | above | and | similar | reasons | these | travel | experiences | may | also | result | in | negative | results | Weaver | et | al | 2017

There | is | increasing | interest | in | the | literature | on | how | the | generation | gap | of | immigrants | affects | their | attachment | to | their | homeland | their | motivation | to | travel | and | their | intention | to | revisit | Diaspora | members | are | not | always | expected | to | be | committed | to | their | homeland | and | have | a | high | motivation | to | travel | and | the | level | of | attachment | may | weaken | as | generations | pass | Otoo | et | al | 2021 | Huang | and | Chen | 2020 | in | a | study | carried | out | to | examine | the | travel | behaviors | of | the | Chinese | diaspora | 5 | generations | living | in | North | America | found | that | the | intention | to | travel | to | the | homeland | differs | among | the | Chinese | migrant | generations | In | addition | according | to | the | results | of | the | study | the | first | generation | migrants | were | determined | as | the | group | with | the | highest | travel | motivation | while | the | second | generation | migrants | were | the | lowest | group

According | to | Li | et | al | 2019 | the | diversification | of | travel | patterns | of | a | diaspora | community | is | related | to | the | consistency | of | that | community | within | itself | The | level | of | acculturation | and | whether | one | identifies | as | part | of | the | ethnic | community | can | also | affect | the | travel | patterns | of | diaspora | tourists | In | addition | sense | of | place | and | place | attachment | are | factors | that | deeply | affect | the | travels | of | diaspora | tourists

According | to | Coles | et | al | 2005 | five | modes | of | travel | can | occur | as | a | result | of | migration

First | individuals | living | as | a | diaspora | in | the | host | country | can | travel | to | their | homeland | Second | people | in | the | diaspora | can | visit | where | their | relatives | live | Third | diasporas | can | travel | to | any | destination | other | than | their | homeland | Fourth | transition | places | in | the | migration | process | can | be | preferred | Fifth | they | can | travel | to | destinations | where | they | can | meet | people | of | the | same | ethnicity | or | with | whom | they | feel | close

Categorizations | are | important | to | understand | the | needs | of | diaspora | tourists | 2019 | efforts | to | develop | typologies | of | diaspora | tourists | show | that | the | popularity | of | these | travels | is | increasing | but | this | effort | is | not | entirely | sufficient | However | most | of | the | diaspora | tourism | studies | focus | on | the | demand | dimension | and | tourist | needs | Huang | et | al | 2018 | Scheyvens | 2007 | and | less | studies | have | been | done | on | the | supply | dimension | Roberts | 2022

One | of | these | studies | belongs | to | Li | et | al | 2019 | Li | et | al | 2019 | proposed | a | conceptual | framework | that | deals | with | the | supply | and | demand | dimensions | of | diaspora | tourism | in | a | holistic | way | In | connection | with | this | study | another | study | dealing | with | the | supply | dimension | of | diaspora | tourism | belongs | to | Roberts | 2022 | Based | on | the | conceptual | framework | proposed | by | Li | et | al | Roberts | 2022 | discussed | the | supply | side | along | with | the | demand | for | diaspora | tourism | in | Guyana

It | is | known | that | some | tourism | products | are | prepared | and | marketed | for | diaspora | communities | around | the | world | Collins | et | al | 2004 | However | considering | the | travel | trends | of | diaspora | tourists | to | the | homeland | it | is | seen | that | the | diaspora | tourism | market | is | underestimated | by | many | tourism | stakeholders | and | governments | Scheyvens | 2007 | Even | when | the | national | statistics | for | the | trips | of | individuals | living | outside | their | homeland | are | examined | it | shows | that | this | market | should | not | be | underestimated

To | give | a | few | examples | when | the | statistics | of | international | tourist | arrivals | of | India | before | the | Covid-19 | pandemic | are | examined | it | is | seen | that | 6.9 | million | of | the | 17.9 | million | tourists | who | came | to | the | country | in | 2019 | were | non | resident | Indians | in | India | Indiastat | 2021 | As | another | example | when | Turkey | 's | 2019 | international | tourist | arrival | statistics | are | analyzed | it | is | seen | that | 15.9 | million | of | the | 51.7 | million | tourists | coming | to | the | country | are | Turks | nonresident | in | Turkey | Turkish | Statistical | Institute | 2021 | While | these | promising | sample | statistics | can | be | diversified | the | diaspora | population | and | structure | of | countries | are | different | from | each | other | However | even | countries | with | a | low | diaspora | population | can | make | economic | gains | from | this | market | and | as | can | be | understood | from | previous | studies | these | individuals | have | a | high | tendency | to | travel | to | the | homeland | and | this | market | should | not | be | ignored | Hughes | Allen | 2008 | Nurse | 2011 | Scheyvens | 2007 | Vong | et | al | 2017

Diaspora | tourism | generally | encourages | independently | planned | trips | with | individual | free | independent | traveller | -FIT | or | a | certain | number | of | immediate | surroundings | rather | than | organized | tours | Butler | 2003 | Among | the | most | important | contributors | to | this | situation | the | migrants | hometowns | may | be | unknown | and | non | touristic | destinations | In | addition | most | of | the | diaspora | tourists | know | the | destination | and | its | surroundings | well | Zhu | Airey | 2021 | As | a | result | it | becomes | difficult | to | develop | and | present | touristic | products | that | can | meet | the | specific | demands | of | diaspora | tourists | The | heterogeneity | of | diaspora | tourists | travel | motivations | and | perceived | low | foreign | exchange | are | some | of | the | reasons | that | make | product | development | difficult | Roberts | 2022 | However | in | order | to | overcome | the | problems | related | to | this | market | which | has | many | advantages | it | is | necessary | for | most | of | the | stakeholders | to | cooperate | to | understand | the | market | better | and | to | develop | effective | marketing | strategies | in | this | context

However | in | order | to | overcome | some | of | the | problems | related | to | this | market | which | has | many | advantages | it | is | necessary | for | most | of | the | stakeholders | to | cooperate | to | understand | the | market | better | and | to | develop | effective | marketing | strategies | Collins | Kreiner | Olsen | 2004 | Li | et | al | 2019

The | current | study | aims | to | review | diaspora | tourism | literatüre | using | a | bibliometric | analysis

Studies | using | bibliometric | analysis | are | guiding | future | studies | It | informs | interested | researchers | about | the | current | state | of | the | literature | and | draws | attention | to | unexplored | issues | Mavric | et | al | 2021 | For | this | bibliometric | study | author | collected | data | in | January | 2022 | from | the | WOS | database | This | study | has | been | carried | out | taking | into | consideration | the | studies | scanned | in | only | WOS | WOS | is | known | as | one | of | the | world | 's | leading | databases | containing | thousands | of | quality | and | high | impact | journals | Yu | et | al | 2019

To | define | the | sample | the | keywords | diaspora | tourism | and | diaspora | tourist | was | used

The | search | was | done | in | the | title | field | When | searching | quotation | marks | were | used | to | exclude | unrelated | studies | from | the | analysis | At | the | end | of | this | process | step | 1 | 37 | documents | such | as | articles | conference | proceedings | book | chapters | and | book | reviews | were | found | in | the | WoS | database | See | Fig | 1 | The | number | of | documents | obtained | as | a | result | of | the | second | and | third | steps | is | 31 | Obtained | data | were | analyzed | with | VOSviewer | software | VOSviewer | 2020 | In | this | study | the | most | productive | journals | the | most | cited | studies | the | most | productive | authors | the | annual | number | of | publications | the | most | contributing | organizations | and | the | most | contributing | countries | were | examined | Huang | et | al | 2016 | argue | in | their | research | that | diaspora | tourists | travel | to | their | homeland | with | 3 | types | of | trips | sightseeing | tours | with | family | independent | family | trips | to | visit | relatives | or | attend | family | events | and | travel | study | programs | In | addition | four | themes | related | to | the | homeland | travels | of | diaspora | tourists | were | identified | in | this | article | language | and | appearance | search | for | authenticity | family | history | and | sense | of | home

The | second | most | cited | work | is | Developing | a | typology | of | diaspora | tourists | Return | travel | by | Chinese | immigrants | in | North | America | with | 32 | citations | It | was | published | by | Li | and | McKercher | in | Tourism | Management | journal | in | 2016 | Five | different | types | of | diaspora | tourists | were | identified | in | the | article | 're | affirmative | quest | diaspora | tourist | reconnected | diaspora | tourist | distanced | diaspora | tourist | and | detached | diaspora | tourist

The | paper | conducted | by | Huang | et | al | 2018 | Attachment | to | the | home | country | or | hometown | Examining | diaspora | tourism | across | migrant | generations | may | be | noticed | in | the | third | place | of | Table | 1 | with | 26 | citations | The | article | gives | ideas | about | the | impact | of | diaspora | tourism | on | regional | development | The | findings | provide | important | implications | for | developing | marketing | strategies | for | many | countries | In | addition | this | article | argues | that | diaspora | tourists | usually | travel | across | the | country | and | these | trips | can | take | a | long | time

Another | study | with | 26 | citations | is | Diaspora | tourism | and | homeland | attachment | an | exploratory | analysis | The | article | was | published | in | 2013 | by | Huang | et | al | published | The | following | most | cited | study | is | Diaspora | tourists | and | the | Scottish | Homecoming | 2009 | with | 23 | citations | published | in | 2013 | in | Journal | of | Heritage | Tourism | Sim | Leith | 2013 | This | followed | by | Experiencing | moments | of | home | through | diaspora | tourism | and | travel | with | 20 | citations | published | in | 2016 | in | Tourism | Geographies | Etemaddar | et | al | 2016 | Li | et | al | 's | 2020 | conceptual | article | Towards | a | conceptual | framework | for | diaspora | tourism | published | in | Annals | of | Tourism | Research | has | 15 | citations | These | studies | are | followed | by | three | studies | with | nine | citations | each |  | In | the | WoS | database | Hong | Kong | Polytechnic | University | is | the | most | productive | university | between | 2000 | 2021 | with | 10 | studies | The | second | most | productive | university | is | Middlesex | University | with | 3 | articles | Six | universities | follow | the | top | two | universities | with | two | publications | each | see | Fig | 4

The | university | that | contributed | the | most | to | diaspora | tourism | publications | is | Hong | Kong | Polytech | University | This | university | appeared | in | ten | studies | on | diaspora | tourism | the | first | of |  | The | Most | Productive | Countries | Regions | Fig | 6 | shows | the | countries | that | contribute | the | most | to | diaspora | tourism | in | WoS. | In | terms | of | continents | Asia | ranks | first | with | 14 | studies | The | continent | of | Asia | is | followed | by | America | 11 | documents | Europe | 6 | documents | Oceania | 4 | documents | and | Africa | 2 | documents | respectively | While | preparing | the | map | countries | that | contributed | more | than | 2 | times | were | taken | into | account | China | is | the | country | that | has | the | most | publications | on | diaspora | tourism | in | WoS. | 12 | documents | In | terms | of | productivity | China | is | followed | by | the | USA | 9 | England | 6 | Jamaica | 2 | Ghana | 2 | New | Zealand | 2 | Vietnam | 2 | Australia | 2

It | is | normal | for | two | countries | with | large | populations | to | be | at | the | top | of | the | list | China | has | a | large | diaspora | population | with | 60 | million | citizens | living | abroad | Zhou | 2017 | The | USA | is | home | to | millions | of | diasporic | individuals | from | various | countries | However | the | lack | of | India | which | has | another | large | diaspora | population | on | the | list | draws | attention | In | addition | it | is | seen | that | Israel | and | Turkey | do | not | contribute | to | the | list | prepared | according | to | WoS | publications

To | describe | the | collaboration | relationship | of | publications | in | WoS | from | 2000 | to | 2021 | author | made | a | co | authorship | analysis | by | VOS | viewer | at | the | level | of | country | region | The | countries | with | at | least | 2 | studies | were | included | in | the | analysis | For | each | of | the | 8 | countries | the | total | strength | of | the | co | authorship | links | with | other | countries | were | calculated | The | countries | with | the | greatest | total | link | strength | were | selected | see | Fig | 7 | keywords | meet | this | threshold | In | addition | Fig | 8 | shows | the | total | link | strengths

Keywords | that | meet | the | threshold | to | be | used | 3 | times | or | more | in | WoS | studies | are | diaspora | tourism | 16 | diaspora | 7 | motivation | 3 | place | attachment | 3 | slavery | 3 | cultural | heritage

This | article | presents | a | bibliometric | analysis | of | the | topic | of | diaspora | tourism | between | 2000 | 2021 | based | on | WoS. | Although | the | current | paper | considers | the | post-2000 | period | it | was | seen | that | the | first | study | on | diaspora | tourism | in | the | WoS | database | was | made | in | 2010 | and | it | has | started | to | attract | the | attention | of | researchers | since | this | year | According | to | the | research | findings | the | most | productive | years | of | studies | on | diaspora | tourism | are | 2020 | and | 2021 | In | the | current | research | many | authors | institutions | and | journals | that | contribute | the | most | to | diaspora | tourism | have | been | identified | In | addition | despite | the | increasing | interest | there | is | no | study | in | which | diaspora | tourism | publications | are | examined | by | bibliometric | analysis | Therefore | the | originality | of | this | study | is | that | it | is | one | of | the | first | studies | to | focus | on | diaspora | tourism | using | bibliometric | analysis | In | addition | studies | with | bibliometric | analysis | are | important | in | revealing | the | hot | topics | of | a | research | topic | and | understanding | the | literature | Wang | et | al | 2020

Contributing | to | the | diaspora | tourism | literature | with | 12 | documents | China | is | the | most | productive | country | followed | by | the | USA | and | the | UK | In | terms | of | the | most | productive | organisations | Hong | Kong | Polytechnic | University | is | by | far | the | first | It | is | not | surprising | with | the | contribution | of | Hong | Kong | Polytechnic | University | that | Asia | ranks | among | the | most | productive | continents | with | 14 | studies | The | continent | of | Asia | is | followed | by | the | continent | of | America | and | Europe | The | most | cited | paper | was | Homecoming | or | tourism | Diaspora | tourism | experience | of | second | generation | immigrants | which | explored | the | diasporic | travels | of | secondgeneration | Chinese | immigrants | and | was | cited | 38 | times | by | December | 2021 | In | addition | studies | focusing | on | the | Chinese | diaspora | are | in | the | top | three | of | the | list | of | the | most | cited | articles | see | table | 1 | The | most | productive | journals | are | Tourism | Geographies | and | Current | Issues | in | Tourism | with | three | articles | each | while | the | most | productive | authors | are | Huang | Wei | Jue | and | Li | Tingting | Elle | with | four | articles | each

In | the | current | research | a | visual | analysis | of | keywords | was | created | using | VOSviewer | see | Fig | 8 | When | keywords | are | analyzed | it | is | not | surprising | that | the | most | common | keywords | are | diaspora | tourism | and | diaspora | In | addition | as | a | result | of | the | visual | analysis | of | the | keywords | it | was | seen | that | three | clusters | were | formed | The | keywords | that | appear | in | the | clusters | are | related | to | each | other | 1 | diaspora | motivation | and | slavery | 2 | diaspora | tourism | and | cultural | heritage | 3 | place | attachment | and | Chinese | diaspora

The | data | obtained | from | bibliometric | analysis | provide | important | clues | for | future | studies | and | researchers | should | consider | these | studies | before | examining | a | subject | Current | article | enables | researchers | to | recognize | gaps | in | the | literature | and | new | research | agendas | In | addition | it | offers | Ciki | K.D.

clues | to | tourism | practitioners | in | revealing | the | deficiencies | in | the | practice | of | diaspora | tourism

It | has | been | mentioned | above | that | the | Chinese | diaspora | is | the | most | studied | community | in | the | context | of | touristic | trips | to | the | homeland | This | is | not | surprising | given | that | it | has | a | large | diaspora | population | However | it | is | clear | that | there | is | a | lack | of | research | on | diasporic | travels | in | other | countries | with | large | diaspora | populations | such | as | India | Israel | and | Turkey | In | addition | it | can | be | said | that | future | generations | should | not | be | ignored | in | order | to | obtain | long | term | benefits | from | diaspora | tourism | Being | aware | of | this | situation | scientists | are | increasingly | interested | in | the | travels | of | second | and | next | generation | immigrants | to | their | homeland

This | study | has | some | limitations | First | the | results | of | the | current | study | considered | articles | published | in | journals | indexed | in | WoS. | This | sampling | preference | does | not | represent | the | entire | field | of | diaspora | tourism | Therefore | future | studies | can | take | into | account | different | databases | and | compare | them | with | current | study | results | In | addition | bibliometric | studies | are | not | only | applied | to | articles | published | in | leading | journals | Koseoglu | et | al | 2016 | Future | bibliometric | studies | on | the | subject | may | also | focus | on | other | publications | conference | proceedings | book | chapter | book | thesis | etc | Homeland | travels | of | immigrants | are | examined | under | various | headings | Secondly | this | study | focuses | on | studies | that | examine | immigrants | homeland | travels | under | the | title | of | diaspora | tourism | Therefore | future | researches | can | focus | on | studies | that | examine | immigrants | homeland | travels | under | various | headings | such | as | visiting | friends | and | relatives | roots | tourism | ethnic | tourism | Finally | while | VOSviewer | software | is | preferred | in | the | current | article | different | software | programs | can | be | used | in | future | research | CiteSpace | etc

Customer | engagement | is | defined | as | a | psychological | process | that | supports | customer | loyalty | Bowden | 2009 | Customers | who | engage | in | brand | pages | on | social | media | platforms | are | in | constant | interaction | with | establishments | Companies | can | promote | their | products | and | services | through | active | use | of | social | media | and | can | follow | the | comments | and | evaluations | made | about | their | brands | Kesgin | Murthy | 2019 | Customer | engagement | has | been | discussed | in | the | literature | especially | regarding | marketing | That | notion | has | also | begun | attracting | attention | in | the | field | of | tourism | in | recent | years | In | addition | there | are | studies | conducted | on | systematic | reviews | for | customer | engagement | in | hospitality | and | tourism | Chen | Han | Bilgihan | Okumus | 2021 | So | Li | Kim | 2020 | In | 2020 | a | special | issue | titled | Customer | Engagement | in | Hospitality | and | Tourism | Services | was | published | in | a | leading | hospitality | and | tourism | journal | So | Li | 2020

Despite | the | increasing | interest | in | the | current | literature | about | customer | engagement | on | social | media | platforms | which | offer | important | opportunities | for | customer | reviews | about | the | brand | the | concept | has | not | been | sufficiently | examined | in | the | field | of | tourism | As | a | result | the | need | for | empirical | research | on | tourism | businesses | has | arisen | Harrigan | et | al | 2017 | The | present | study | examines | the | factors | that | cause | customers | to | engage | in | social | media | platforms | of | accommodation | establishments | and | seeks | to | determine | whether | these | factors | differ | in | significance | based | on | the | customer | 's | demography | In | this | study | customer | engagement | is | examined | in | detail | using | the | mixed | method | design | and | a | new | set | of | dimensions | are | introduced | to | the | literature | In | addition | based | on | the | new | results | obtained | by | considering | demographic | variables | suggestions | are | made | for | future | studies | especially | for | marketing | managers | in | the | sector

The | first | use | of | the | engagement | term | to | describe | issues | including | moral | or | legal | obligation | duty | bond | military | conflict | and | employment | for | instance | dates | to | the | 17th | century | Hollebeek | Glynn | Brodie | 2014 | The | concept | of | engagement | which | attracts | attention | in | many | academic | disciplines | such | as | psychology | sociology | political | science | and | organizational | behavior | has | been | increasingly | used | in | the | marketing | literature | since | 2005 | Brodie | Hollebeek | Juric | Ilic | 2011 | A | literature | review | shows | that | engagement | represents | a | multidimensional | concept | that | includes | cognitive | behavioral | and | emotional | dimensions | Brodie | Ilic | Juric | Hollebeek | 2013

Comparatively | the | concept | of | customer | engagement | continues | to | evolve | in | the | marketing | literature | Brands | products | organizations | and | brand | communities | are | key | engagement | elements | stated | in | the | literature | Although | there | are | many | marketing | studies | that | discuss | the | concept | of | engagement | the | definition | dimensions | and | operationalization | of | customer | engagement | are | inconsistent | and | complex | Cheung | Lee | Jin | 2011

Bowden | 2009 | described | customer | engagement | as | a | psychological | process | that | supports | customer | loyalty | and | primarily | examined | the | formation | and | development | of | customer | relationships | According | to | Brodie | et | al | 2011 | customer | engagement | is | a | psychological | state | characterized | by | levels | of | intensity | that | occur | in | dynamic | repetitive | processes | of | engagement

Customer | engagement | on | virtual | brand | pages | includes | private | interactive | experiences | between | customers | and | other | members | of | the | brand | or | community | Customer | engagement | is | related | to | contexts | where | customers | can | create | value | develop | a | competitive | strategy | collaborate | in | the | firm | 's | innovation | process | and | internalize | the | company | Harmeling | Moffett | Arnold | Carlson | 2017

The | concept | of | customer | engagement | is | also | mentioned | as | brand | engagement | and | customer | brand | engagement | in | the | literature | Baldus | Voorhees | Calantone | 2015 | Dwivedi | 2015 | Hollebeek | et | al | 2014 | Karjaluoto | Munnukka | Tiensuu | 2015 | Today | customers | can | interact | directly | with | a | brand | discuss | evaluate | and | publicly | establish | personal | connections | with | it | without | making | any | purchases | These | capabilities | that | customers | acquire | by | means | of | today | 's | technology | form | the | structure | of | the | concept | of | customer | brand | engagement | Bijmolt | et | al | 2010 | van | Doorn | et | al | 2010 | define | brand | engagement | as | a | brand | or | companyoriented | behavioral | manifestation | that | results | from | motivational | factors | beyond | purchasing

Wide | network | elements | including | other | current | and | potential | customers | suppliers | the | general | public | and | company | employees | are | also | targeted

The | notion | of | interactive | experience | underlies | the | concept | of | brand | engagement | The | focal | point | is | the | customer | it | is | the | level | of | emotional | cognitive | and | behavioral | interactions | of | customers | directly | with | the | brand | or | with | other | users | of | the | brand | on | a | brand | 's | online | platform | Brodie | et | al | 2011 | Customer | brand | engagement | is | discussed | in | three | dimensions | cognitive | emotional | and | behavioral | The | cognitive | dimension | is | defined | as | the | level | of | reflection | and | elaboration | of | the | customer | 's | thoughts | about | the | brand | in | brand | interaction | The | emotional | dimension | is | the | customer | 's | love | for | the | brand | and | positive | interaction | with | the | brand | or | other | customers | Finally | the | behavioral | dimension | is | the | level | of | energy | effort | and | time | that | the | customer | spends | for | a | brand | in | customer | brand | interaction | Hollebeek | et | al | 2014

The | 2015 | Dimensions | of | customer | engagement | that | are | most | frequently | discussed | in | the | literature | are | as | follows

Identity | Identity | from | the | perspective | of | the | customer | refers | to | the | individual | 's | sense | of | belonging | to | a | brand | So | et | al | 2016 | Customers | may | identify | themselves | with | a | particular | brand | They | express | this | through | the | posts | they | share | on | the | brand | 's | social | media | page | The | user | group | who | perceive | the | brand | 's | social | media | community | as | us | rather | than | them | may | interpret | a | negative | critique | of | the | brand | as | a | personal | criticism | or | may | perceive | a | praise | of | the | brand | as | a | personal | compliment | Harrigan | et | al | 2017

Information | The | information | dimension | can | be | expressed | as | the | fact | that | brand | pages | inform | their | followers | about | the | brand | and | product | through | the | posts | they | share | and | help | them | to | stay | up | to | date | Baldus | et | al | 2015 | The | need | for | information | is | one | of | the | main | factors | that | ensures | engagement | in | online | brand | communities | Karjaluoto | et | al | 2015 | According | to | another | definition | the | information | dimension | is | the | exchange | of | ideas | that | occurs | among | visitors | and | in | this | context | the | gain | of | members | of | the | online | community | who | look | for | information | Therefore | information | is | a | communication | model | that | emerges | from | the | interaction | of | the | individual | with | other | customers | and | that | has | a | positive | contribution | to | the | individual | Kesgin | Murthy | 2019 | VanMeter | et | al | 2015 | Benefit | The | benefit | dimension | is | the | gains | resulting | from | being | a | part | of | a | brand | community | that | motivate | them | to | increase | their | involvement | in | the | community | The | benefit | dimension | focuses | on | the | individual | It | is | essentially | a | feeling | of | self | esteem | and | general | happiness | that | community | members | gain | by | interacting | with | other | members | Kesgin | Murthy | 2019 | According | to | another | approach | the | benefit | is | the | degree | to | which | a | community | member | gains | utilitarian | rewards | such | as | monetary | rewards | or | time | savings | through | their | participation | in | the | community | Baldus | et | al | 2015 | The | economic | benefits | obtained | make | being | a | part | of | the | brand | community | attractive | Karjaluato | et | al | 2015

Experience | Experience | is | the | perception | that | remains | in | the | mind | of | the | customer | after | brand | use | the | customer | remembers | the | brand | through | this | perception

Experience | is | subjective | because | it | is | built | on | the | individual | 's | perceptions | and | thoughts | During | the | interaction | with | the | brand | that | triggers | the | senses | and | arouses | emotion | the | customer | creates | the | perception | of | experience | by | comparing | their | expectations | with | their | experiences | The | way | that | brand | use | occurs | causes | the | resulting | experience | to | be | positive | or | negative | Giving | feedback | to | user | complaints | arising | from | negative | comments | and | behavior | by | responding | quickly | and | in | a | timely | manner | has | a | strong | impact | on | the | customers | experience | Positive | experiences | make | customers | feel | that | the | brand | page | is | specially | made | for | them | and | strengthen | their | loyalty | to | the | brand | Potdar | et | al | 2018

Satisfaction | Satisfaction | is | that | sense | when | a | customer | thinks | that | a | decision | to | purchase | a | product | or | a | service | from | a | brand | is | correct | and | that | the | brand | meets | their | expectations | Dwivedi | 2015 | Satisfaction | which | is | the | result | of | an | examination | in | the | mind | of | the | customer | over | the | brand | experiences | is | the | situation | in | which | the | customer | 's | expectations | and | brand | performance | match | Brand | interaction | increases | customer | engagement | when | it | leads | to | customer | satisfaction | The | brand | supports | customer | satisfaction | with | the | positive | experiences | it | provides | through | social | media | Potdar | et | al | 2018

Literature | review | shows | that | studies | on | customer | engagement | are | limited | and | that | such | studies | have | only | begun | to | be | carried | out | in | recent | years | In | general | there | are | studies | in | areas | such | as | health | banking | automotive | and | tourism | The | conceptual | and | empirical | studies | on | customer | engagement | that | were | found | are | shown | in | Tab | 1

Demographic | variables | have | an | important | place | in | studies | that | examine | social | media | users | Chang | Choi | Bazarova | Löckenhoff | 2015 | and | consumer | behavior | Kim | Kim | 2021 | Rasoolimanesh | et.al | 2021 | in | the | field | of | marketing | Age | and | gender | come | to | the | forefront | most | frequently | referred | among | these | variables | Rather | Hollebeek | 2021 | Schirmer | Ringle | Gudergan | Feistel | 2018 | However | there | are | few | studies | that | discuss | demographic | variables | in | the | context | of | online | customer | engagement | Yay | 2021 | Gupta | 2021 | Msallati | 2021 | Islam | Rahman | 2017 | Osei | Frimpong | 2019 | Yay | 2021 | examined | the | effect | of | experienscape | components | on | the | engagement | in | online | brand | communities | for | restaurant | establishments | and | found | that | there | was | a | significant | difference | between | customer | engagement | dimensions | by | gender | age | and | education | level | Gupta | 2021 | in | examining | the | effect | of | customer | engagement | in | mobile | travel | applications | on | customer | value | reported | significant | differences | in | engagement | levels | in | travel | mobile | applications | by | gender | age | occupation | and | time | spent | in | the | application | In | another | study | Msallati | 2021 | determined | a | moderating | effect | of | generations | X | Y | Z | in | the | relationship | between | the | types | of | advertising | messages | and | customer | engagement | Islam | and | Rahman | 2017 | found | no | moderating | effect | of | gender | in | their | study | that | examined | the | effect | of | online | brand | community | features | on | customer | engagement | Osei | Frimpong | 2019 | investigated | the | effect | of | consumer | motivation | on | online | social | brand | engagement | and | found | that | gender | and | age | had | partial | moderating | effects | It | is | seen | in | the | abovementioned | studies | examining | online | customer | engagement | that | age | and | gender | factors | come | to | the | fore | and | are | used | as | study | variables

The | exploratory | sequential | mixed | method | research | MMR | design | was | used | in | this | study | The | purpose | of | the | two | stage | exploratory | design | is | that | the | data | obtained | from | the | first | stage | the | qualitative | stage | helps | to | develop | and | provide | data | for | the | second | the | quantitative | stage | Bryman | 2012 | Creswell | 2017

In | the | qualitative | phase | of | the | study | netnography | which | is | an | adaptation | form | of | ethnography | a | qualitative | research | method | to | the | virtual | environment | was | used | This | method | was | preferred | because | of | the | widespread | use | of | the | internet | in | tourism | It | also | simplifies | data | collection | and | allows | companies | to | observe | customers | interactions | Tavakoli | Wijesinghe | 2019 | Content | analysis | was | applied | to | the | data | collected | using | this | method

The | quantitative | stage | was | planned | based | on | the | qualitative | results | in | the | second | stage | of | the | study | Firstly | a | questionnaire | was | prepared | for | the | purpose | of | measuring | the | engagement | of | customers | in | social | media | platforms | of | hospitality | establishments | and | the | reasons | why | they | share | posts | on | these | platforms | The | themes | obtained | from | the | analysis | of | the | qualitative | data | and | the | literature | review | were | taken | as | the | basis | for | the | preparation | of | the | questionnaire

Qualitative | research | the | first | stage | of | the | study | was | carried | out | based | on | user | reviews | from | the | corporate | Facebook | page | of | a | 5 | star | hotel | in | Alanya | Turkey | At | the | quantitative | stage | of | the | study | social | media | users | who | interacted | with | the | social | media | platforms | of | the | accommodation | establishment | and | engaged | formed | the | scope | of | the | study | The | questionnaire | was | prepared | only | in | Turkish | and | was | limited | to | the | participants | using | this | language | The | validity | and | reliability | of | the | data | obtained | are | limited | to | the | candid | responses | of | the | people | who | answered | the | online | questionnaire

In | this | stage | of | the | study | visitors | of | the | corporate | Facebook | page | of | a | 5 | star | hotel | located | in | Alanya | Turkey | were | chosen | as | the | sample | This | hotel | business | was | chosen | because | of | the | professional | management | of | the | Facebook | page | the | high | number | of | followers | interactions | and | customer | comments | and | the | regular | content | sharing | by | the | business

A | total | of | 383 | customers | have | expressed | their | opinions | on | the | social | media | platform | of | the | hotel | Customer | comments | on | the | Facebook | page | of | the | hotel | were | collected | manually | by | the | researcher | without | using | any | software | Data | were | collected | in | September | 2018 | Customer | comments | on | the | social | media | platform | of | the | relevant | hotel | after | September | were | excluded | from | the | scope | of | the | study

The | reliability | and | validity | model | developed | by | Guba | 1981 | which | includes | the | stages | of | credibility | consistency | transferability | and | verifiability | was | used | to | measure | the | reliability | of | the | qualitative | part | of | the | study | Starting | from | this | point | of | view | the | stages | related | to | reliability | were | applied | in | this | study | as | follows

Credibility | Internal | validity | To | increase | internal | validity | in | the | study | screenshots | of | customer | comments | made | on | the | social | media | platform | of | the | hotel | were | used | Direct | quotations | from | customer | comments | were | included | in | the | presentation | of | the | data | to | increase | credibility

To | increase | the | internal | reliability | of | the | study | the | coding | processes | were | carried | out | separately | by | two | researchers | at | different | times | the | issues | of | consensus | and | disagreement | were | determined | and | necessary | corrections | were | made | The | reliability | formula | proposed | by | Miles | and | Huberman | 1994 | p | consensus | consensus | disagreement | was | calculated | and | a | consensus | of | 95 | p | 0.95 | was | obtained | between | the | two | researchers

Transferability | External | validity | Each | stage | of | the | data | collection | and | analysis | process | was | described | in | detail | so | that | readers | could | better | understand | and | visualize | each | process | of | the | study | The | current | picture | was | shown | by | giving | as | much | detailed | information | as | possible | in | the | results | and | comments | section | The | aim | was | that | different | readers | could | understand | the | same | meaning | using | a | clear | and | simple | language | in | the | writing | of | the | study

To | ensure | external | reliability | verifiability | in | the | study | all | raw | data | customer | comments | site | screenshots | obtained | were | kept | by | the | researcher | for | the | relevant | persons | and | institutions | to | examine | Information | about | the | hotel | was | deleted | in | the | quotations | sent | so | that | the | hotel | within | the | scope | of | the | study | would | not | be | understood | by | the | readers | The | personal | information | of | the | customers | within | the | scope | of | the | study | was | hidden | and | each | customer | was | assigned | a | sequential | number | C1 | C2

The | themes | in | Tab | 2 | were | created | as | a | result | of | the | analysis | of | the | data | on | the | engagement | of | the | customers | in | the | social | media | platform | of | the | hotel

The | convenience | sampling | method | was | used | because | the | study | included | a | very | large | population | and | the | definite | number | of | the | participants | could | not | be | determined | The | sample | in | the | quantitative | stage | of | the | study | comprised | 602 | people | who | filled | out | the | questionnaire | form | online | The | electronic | form | of | the | questionnaire | was | shared | on | the | social | media | account | of | the | accommodation | establishment | where | the | qualitative | study | was | conducted | and | on | other | social | media | channels | the | customers | who | interacted | with | the | accommodation | establishment | in | question | were | contacted | as | much | as | possible | We | contacted | administrators | of | highly | rated | pages | on | Facebook | Twitter | and | Instagram | on | topics | covering | accommodation | and | vacation | topics | We | sent | a | questionnaire | form | to | the | followers | and | members | of | these | pages | Individual | messages | were | sent | to | the | followers | on | the | LinkedIn | platform | and | feedback | was | obtained

It | was | planned | that | the | questionnaire | form | would | be | completed | as | an | online | questionnaire | and | applied | to | internet | users | While | preparing | the | items | for | customer | engagement | the | themes | and | sub | categories | obtained | from | qualitative | data | were | used | and | dimensions | of | similar | research | were | also | considered | by | the | authors | Calder | et | al | 2009 | Harrigan | et | al | 2017 | Lobschat | et | al | 2013 | Karjaluoto | et | al | 2015 | Potdar | et | al | 2018 | Kesgin | Murthy | 2019 | So | et | al | 2014 | To | structure | the | questionnaire | form | an | item | pool | containing | 42 | questions | in | total | was | created | for | the | dimensions | of | customer | engagement | the | first | form | was | prepared | with | a | total | of | 46 | questions | by | adding | demographic | questions | The | items | were | prepared | using | a | 5 | point | Likerttype | scale | where | 1 | indicated | completely | disagree | and | 5 | completely | agree

The | items | in | the | item | pool | were | examined | by | a | group | of | 20 | academics | and | experts | After | this | review | some | items | were | changed | and | rewritten | In | addition | the | number | of | items | was | reduced | 31 | were | selected | from | the | pool | that | included | 42 | items | A | 35 | question | original | questionnaire | form | was | created | by | adding | demographic | questions | A | pilot | study | was | conducted | with | 40 | people | before | the | actual | implementation | The | alpha | coefficient | was | 0.92 | which | showed | very | high | reliability | Before | the | survey | was | administered | the | required | information | was | given | to | the | participants | It | was | emphasized | that | there | were | no | right | or | wrong | answers | in | the | survey | and | that | each | answer | completely | would | reflect | personal | views | and | beliefs | Participants | were | asked | to | complete | the | survey | on | a | voluntary | basis | Data | were | collected | from | December | 2018 | to | March | 2019

The | data | were | analyzed | using | SPSS | and | AMOS | 24 | software | packages | The | alpha | value | was | 0.93 | based | on | the | reliability | analysis | of | the | scale | showing | that | the | scale | was | highly | reliable

First | whether | the | data | were | normally | distributed | was | checked | to | determine | the | type | of | tests | to | be | performed | The | skewness | and | kurtosis | values | of | the | data | were | taken | as | reference | in | the | applied | normal | distribution | test | As | a | result | the | skewness | value | for | the | customer | engagement | scale | was | found | to | be | -0.530 | and | the | kurtosis | value | -0.279 | Since | these | values | were | regarded | acceptable | for | normal | distribution | Hair | et | al | 2014 | then | factor | analysis | and | parametric | tests | t | test | and | ANOVA | test | were | applied

An | exploratory | factor | analysis | EFA | was | applied | for | the | construct | validity | of | the | measurement | tool | created | It | was | seen | in | the | factor | analysis | carried | out | after | the | Varimax | rotation | that | items | 2 | 15 | and | 27 | were | not | included | in | any | dimension | and | that | items | 9 | 14 | 16 | 26 | and | 28 | had | not | gathered | under | the | expected | factors | Accordingly | 8 | items | stated | were | removed | from | the | scale | and | the | analysis | was | repeated | a | structure | with | 7 | factors | was | obtained | Tab | 3 | The | KMO | Kaiser | Meyer | Olkin | value | was | .892 | for | the | online | customer | engagement | scale | and | that | the | rate | of | explaining | the | total | variance | was | 87.30 | for | the | scale | As | can | be | seen | in | Tab | 3 | the | factor | appreciation | had | not | been | previously | found | in | the | literature | In | addition | the | dimensions | benefit | and | experience | that | were | discussed | separately | in | the | literature | were | combined | under | a | single | dimension | as | a | result | of | the | analysis | Accordingly | this | dimension | was | named | experiential | benefit | because | it | expresses | the | items | collected | under | the | dimensions | of | benefit | and | experience | The | factor | loads | of | the | scale | items | varied | from | 0.673 | to | 0.930 |  | After | performing | the | EFA | confirmatory | factor | analysis | CFA | was | employed | to | assess | the | obtained | factor | structures | According | to | the | CFA | results | in | Tab | 4 | all | standardized | regression | values | for | the | items | are | over | 0.66 | All | scale | items | have | high | t | values | and | they | are | statistically | significant | p<0.001 | To | improve | the | fit | indices | the | proposed | modifications | were | made | between | the | items | EB23 | EB24 | EB24 | EB25 | and | S12 | S13 | After | performing | the | modifications | results | of | the | CFA | indicated | that | the | goodness | of | fit | indices | of | the | conceptual | model | χ2 | 870.424 | df | 206 | χ2 | df | 4.225 | RMSEA | 0.073 | CFI | 0.956 | NFI | 0.944 | IFI | 0.956 | were | acceptable | Hair | et | al | 2014 | Marsh | Hau | 1996 |  | The | CFA | results | were | presented | regarding | the | validity | of | the | online | customer | engagement | scale | in | Tab | 4 | Average | variance | extracted | AVE | values | should | be | 0.50 | composite | reliability | CR | values | should | be | 0.70 | and | all | standardized | factor | loads | for | scale | items | should | be | 0.50 | to | ensure | convergent | validity | of | the | scale | Hair | et | al | 2014 | Furthermore | Tab | 4 | shows | that | CR | values | are | greater | than | AVE | values | Thus | the | convergent | validity | of | the | scale | was | ensured

The | correlation | matrix | and | the | square | root | of | the | AVE | values | were | also | calculated | to | test | the | discriminant | validity | of | the | scale | Tab | 5 | The | square | root | of | the | AVE | value | for | each | latent | variable | should | be | greater | than | the | other | correlation | values | between | the | latent | variables | Fornell | Larcker | 1981 | The | results | in | Tab | 5 | show | that | the | scale | also | has | discriminant | validity

A | t | test | for | independent | samples | was | administered | to | determine | whether | the | gender | and | the | marital | status | of | the | participants | demonstrate | a | statistically | significant | impact | on | the | engagement | on | social | media | platforms | One | way | analysis | of | variance | ANOVA | was | applied | to | determine | whether | there | was | a | significant | difference | based | on | age | and | education | levels | the | analysis | results | are | shown | in | Tab | 6 | and | Tab | 7 | Tab | 6 | shows | that | there | was | no | significant | gender | related | difference | in | the | mean | scores | of | experiential | benefit | appreciation | satisfaction | advocacy | identity | recommendation | and | customer | engagement | p | 0.05 | However | there | was | a | significant | difference | in | the | information | dimension | according | to | gender | p | 0.05 | The | men | 's | mean | information | dimension | score | was | higher | than | the | women | 's | score | for | the | same | dimension

According | to | other | results | there | was | no | significant | difference | between | the | mean | scores | of | experiential | benefit | appreciation | identity | recommendation | and | customer | engagement | by | marital | status | p | 0.05 | However | a | significant | difference | was | found | between | the | dimensions | of | satisfaction | advocacy | information | and | marital | status | p | 0.05 | For | married | participants | the | mean | values | of | the | advocacy | and | information | dimensions | were | higher | On | the | other | hand | for | single | participants | the | mean | value | of | the | satisfaction | dimension | was | higher

According | to | the | ANOVA | test | results | in | Tab | 7 | there | was | no | significant | difference | between | the | mean | score | of | experiential | benefit | appreciation | identity | and | customer | engagement | by | education | level | p | 0.05 | However | there | was | a | significant | difference | between | satisfaction | recommendation | advocacy | and | information | dimensions | and | educational | status | p | 0.05 | Based | on | the | Tukey | test | results | for | primary | school | graduate | participants | the | mean | values | of | the | satisfaction | and | recommendation | dimensions | were | higher | than | those | with | associate | degrees | Regarding | the | advocacy | dimension | the | mean | scores | of | the | participants | with | high | school | and | associate | degrees | were | found | to | be | higher | than | those | of | the | primary | school | and | undergraduate | graduates | The | mean | information | dimension | scores | of | the | associate | degree | and | high | school | graduates | were | higher | those | of | the | undergraduate | postgraduate | and | primary | school | graduates | There | was | no | significant | difference | by | age | in | the | experiential | benefit | appreciation | satisfaction | identity | recommendation | and | customer | engagement | dimensions | p | 0.05 | However | there | was | a | significant | difference | between | the | mean | scores | of | advocacy | and | information | dimensions | by | age | p | 0.05 | Based | on | Tukey | test | results | the | mean | advocacy | dimension | scores | for | the | participants | in | the | age | group | of | 46 | and | older | were | higher | than | those | of | the | participants | in | the | age | groups | 25 | and | younger | and | between | 31 | 35 | Regarding | the | information | dimension | the | mean | scores | of | the | participants | in | the | 36 | 40 | and | 46 | and | over | age | groups | were | higher | than | those | of | the | participants | in | the | 26 | 30 | and | 25 | and | below | age | groups

This | study | examines | the | engagement | of | customers | using | social | media | platforms | of | accommodation | establishments | and | also | evaluated | the | reasons | that | led | them | to | their | engagement | First | a | content | analysis | was | done | based | on | the | customer | reviews | sent | via | the | Facebook | page | of | a | 5 | star | hotel | using | the | exploratory | sequential | design | method | then | the | scope | was | enlarged | with | quantitative | research | reaching | a | larger | sample | As | a | result | of | the | qualitative | analysis | the | reasons | for | customers | online | engagement | were | classified | under | ten | dimensions | satisfaction | advocacy | identity | appreciation | benefit | affiliation | requestsuggestion | information | experience | and | recommendation | With | the | quantitative | study | these | dimensions | were | tested | with | the | online | survey | method | to | include | users | who | follow | the | social | media | pages | of | the | accommodation | establishments | Through | the | quantitative | study | the | participants | reasons | of | engagement | in | the | accommodation | establishment | pages | were | seen | to | have | gathered | under | seven | dimensions | experiential | benefit | satisfaction | advocacy | appreciation | identity | recommendation | and | information | The | request | suggestion | and | affiliation | dimensions | determined | in | qualitative | research | were | not | factored | into | the | quantitative | research | The | dimensions | of | benefit | and | experience | which | emerged | as | two | different | dimensions | in | the | content | analysis | were | unified | under | a | single | factor | as | the | experiential | benefit | in | the | quantitative | research | This | dimension | can | be | explained | as | the | benefit | obtained | as | a | result | of | sharing | positive | or | negative | experiences | Warning | others | or | sharing | positive | experiences | guides | customers | in | their | purchase | decisions | In | this | regard | Calder | et | al | 2009 | explained | the | concept | of | benefit | and | mentioned | the | experiential | benefit | and | the | economic | benefit | When | the | content | on | a | social | media | platform | is | interesting | it | helps | in | decision | making | and | when | it | provides | people | with | distance | from | the | stresses | of | daily | life | that | shows | the | benefits | of | shared | experiences

Another | factor | satisfaction | emerged | as | the | dimension | with | the | highest | values | that | led | customers | to | engage | in | social | media | platforms | of | the | accommodation | establishments | in | both | content | and | quantitative | analyses | Participants | used | social | media | platforms | extensively | to | share | their | satisfaction | with | accommodation | establishments | The | results | also | that | visitors | shared | positive | emotions | more | frequently | It | was | determined | that | in | the | information | dimension | as | in | the | satisfaction | dimension | visitors | used | social | media | pages | widely | to | obtain | up | to | date | information | about | the | accommodation | establishments | and | to | inform | other | users | based | on | their | positive | or | negative | experiences | with | the | service

The | recommendation | factor | also | had | a | high | level | of | engagement | on | social | media | platforms | Potdar | et | al | 2018 | stated | in | their | studies | in | which | they | discussed | customer | brand | engagement | as | a | process | the | recommendation | factor | is | the | point | to | be | reached | and | had | a | high | degree | of | importance | in | customer | engagement | It | was | found | as | a | result | of | the | content | analysis | that | the | appreciation | factor | which | was | determined | by | including | the | expressions | of | the | participants | to | convey | their | appreciation | to | the | establishment | had | a | high | level | of | importance | in | customer | brand | engagement | Finally | it | can | be | argued | that | the | identity | and | advocacy | dimensions | had | a | moderate | level | of | importance | in | the | engagement | of | accommodation | establishments | on | social | media | platforms

Unlike | in | the | published | literature | in | this | study | the | request | suggestion | and | appreciation | dimensions | were | also | determined | Other | dimensions | determined | in | this | study | were | similar | to | those | that | were | found | in | previous | papers | Kesgin | and | Murthy | 's | 2019 | study | in | the | tourism | sector | discusses | the | dimensions | of | information | benefit | advocacy | affiliation | and | identity | In | a | study | that | Potdar | et | al | 2018 | conducted | on | the | banking | sector | they | developed | a | customer | engagement | process | model | that | includes | experience | satisfaction | affiliation | and | recommendation | dimensions | Lobschat | et | al | 2013 | in | their | study | on | the | automotive | sector | revealed | a | multidimensional | structure | that | includes | the | dimensions | of | advocacy | information | affiliation | and | identity | Karjaluoto | et | al | 2015 | carried | out | a | study | reviewing | Facebook | fans | and | Twitter | followers | of | an | international | electronics | company | and | presented | a | five | dimension | customer | engagement | structure | that | includes | information | and | identity | dimensions

In | the | present | study | the | relationships | between | the | demographic | characteristics | of | the | participants | and | their | perceptions | of | these | dimensions | were | also | examined | after | the | dimensions | of | customer | engagement | in | accommodation | establishments | had | been | determined

It | was | concluded | based | on | that | analysis | that | there | was | only | a | significant | between | gender | and | the | information | dimension | Accordingly | it | is | possible | to | say | that | men | use | social | media | platforms | of | accommodation | establishments | more | actively | to | obtain | information | about | brands | and | to | inform | others | Contrary | to | this | study | Yay | 2021 | found | no | significant | difference | between | gender | and | the | information | dimension | in | a | study | in | which | the | researcher | examined | the | engagement | of | customers | in | online | brand | communities | in | restaurant | establishments | There | are | studies | that | have | examined | the | relationship | between | gender | and | consumer | engagement | in | general | though | not | directly | similar | to | the | above | mentioned | studies | Gupta | 2021 | found | a | significant | difference | between | the | level | of | engagement | in | travel | mobile | applications | and | gender | Accordingly | women | 's | level | of | engagement | in | travel | mobile | applications | was | higher | than | that | of | men | Osei | Frimpong | 2019 | determined | that | gender | played | a | partial | moderator | role | in | the | effect | of | consumer | motivation | on | online | social | brand | engagement | In | contrast | Islam | and | Rahman | 2017 | found | that | gender | did | not | have | a | moderator | effect | on | the | relationship | between | brand | community | characteristics | and | customer | engagement

A | significant | difference | was | found | between | marital | status | and | the | information | satisfaction | and | advocacy | dimensions | In | this | study | the | advocacy | and | information | dimensions | came | to | the | forefront | in | the | married | participants | engagement | in | social | media | brands | however | the | satisfaction | dimension | was | more | important | for | single | participants | Contrary | to | that | result | Yay | 2021 | found | no | significant | difference | between | the | information | and | satisfactionrecommendation | dimension | by | marital | status | There | was | a | significant | difference | between | educational | status | and | the | satisfaction | advocacy | information | and | recommendation | dimensions | in | this | study | Yay | 2021 | found | a | significant | difference | in | identity | dimension | by | educational | status

Finally | a | significant | difference | was | found | between | the | ages | of | the | participants | and | the | advocacy | and | information | dimensions | It | is | seen | that | as | age | increases | the | act | of | advocating | a | brand | on | social | media | increases | In | the | Yay | 2021 | study | there | is | a | significant | difference | between | the | age | of | the | participants | and | the | perceptions | of | satisfaction | recommendation | dimensions | only | however | there | is | no | significant | difference | between | age | and | information | and | identity | dimensions | Looking | at | the | studies | examining | the | relationship | between | age | and | online | customer | engagement | in | general | Msallati | 2021 | determined | that | generations | X | Y | Z | have | a | moderator | effect | on | the | relationship | between | advertising | messages | and | customer | engagement | Gupta | 2021 | found | significant | differences | in | the | level | of | engagement | in | travel | mobile | applications | by | age | Osei | Frimpong | 2019 | found | that | age | has | a | partial | moderator | role | in | the | effect | of | consumers | motivation | on | their | engagement | with | brands | on | social | media

The | most | important | contribution | of | this | study | to | the | literature | is | that | it | provides | an | in | depth | analysis | of | customer | engagement | dimensions | in | accommodation | establishments | using | a | mixed | method | approach | and | allows | the | determined | dimensions | to | be | tested | concurrently | using | a | large | sample | It | also | reveals | important | results | in | terms | of | the | role | of | demographic | variables

Based | on | these | results | the | following | points | can | be | recommended | to | researchers | in | future | studies | and | practitioners | digital | marketing | managers | and | tourism | professionals | in | the | tourism | sector | Significant | differences | were | found | between | the | information | dimension | and | all | demographic | variables | gender | marital | status | age | and | education | level | in | engagement | in | social | media | brand | platforms | Marketing | managers | can | create | strategies | that | take | these | variables | into | account | in | the | management | of | online | platforms | where | customers | intensively | engage | for | the | purpose | of | being | informed | and | informing | others

This | study | showed | that | some | dimensions | differed | significantly | with | age | Accordingly | the | change | in | customer | engagement | based | on | generation | should | be | investigated | in | new | studies | Understanding | customer | engagement | by | generation | will | be | beneficial | for | accommodation | establishments | in | terms | of | following | strategies | based | on | age | groups | in | their | target | audience | It | will | be | beneficial | for | practitioners | to | create | content | by | considering | the | dimensions | of | consumer | engagement | while | creating | the | social | media | calendar | to | increase | their | interactions | with | social | media

In | the | qualitative | study | coding | was | done | by | considering | the | reviews | made | by | the | users | on | the | social | media | pages | The | content | shared | by | the | companies | should | be | divided | into | themes | in | future | studies | determining | thereby | which | content | type | most | encourages | customers | to | engage

The | request | recommendation | dimension | which | was | obtained | with | high | frequency | in | the | content | analysis | that | constitutes | the | first | part | of | the | study | and | which | had | not | been | determined | in | previous | empirical | studies | in | the | literature | should | be | tested | in | academic | studies | on | the | subject | in | the | future

Future | studies | are | suggested | to | be | carried | out | using | different | accommodation | establishments | or | travel | agencies | Moreover | different | social | media | platforms | with | high | popularity | should | be | examined | separately

Understanding | the | characteristics | of | different | cultures | is | very | important | for | the | tourism | sector | For | this | reason | it | would | be | useful | to | conduct | new | studies | that | account | for | cultural | differences | in | customer | engagement

The | data | obtained | in | the | qualitative | part | of | the | study | conducted | within | the | scope | of | online | customer | engagement | are | limited | to | the | reviews | of | the | customers | of | a | hotel | on | the | Facebook | platform | in | September | 2018 | However | considering | the | limited | number | of | published | studies | on | this | issue | it | is | expected | that | this | study | will | contribute | to | future | research | In | the | quantitative | research | part | of | the | study | seven | customer | engagement | dimensions | were | determined | experiential | benefit | satisfaction | advocacy | appreciation | identity | recommendation | and | information | The | appreciation | dimension | is | the | original | contribution | of | this | study | to | the | literature | Future | studies | will | be | carried | out | in | the | tourism | industry | focusing | on | different | regions | and | customer | groups | of | different | nationalities | Furthermore | other | future | research | directions | may | cover | other | factors | relating | to | customer | engagement | on | social | media | such | as | customer | loyalty | customer | trust | and | customer | perception

The | circular | economy | approach | is | not | only | the | subject | of | scientific | works | but | also | interweaves | our | everyday | lives | In | addition | to | the | growing | number | of | domestic | and | international | scientific | research | we | also | recognize | the | importance | of | protecting | the | environment | at | the | community | level | In | addition | to | individual | responsibility | economic | organizations | have | also | put | the | circular | approach | at | the | forefront | and | they | seek | to | continue | and | transform | their | activities | in | accordance | with | this | Numerous | research | articles | have | been | published | examining | the | positive | correlations | between | the | culture | of | sustainability | Schönborn | et | al | 2019 | sustainability | practices | Alshehhi | et | al | 2018 | and | the | adaptation | of | the | principles | of | the | circular | economy | to | corporate | practice | in | relation | with | different | elements | of | corporate | performance | Rehman | Khan | et | al | 2021 | Moric | et | al | 2020 | including | financial | performance | Uhrenholt | et | al | 2022 | Fernando | et | al | 2022 | Johl | Toha | 2021

Environmental | principles | have | also | been | integrated | into | corporate | decision | making | Bedenik | et | al | 2019 | The | concepts | and | solutions | of | sustainability | resource | efficiency | and | zero | waste | production | are | increasingly | becoming | part | of | our | thinking | policy | guidelines | and | corporate | strategies | Kiss | et | al | 2019

In | the | Energy | 2020 | document | the | European | Union | has | set | three | targets | for | energy | efficiency | the | share | of | renewable | energy | and | greenhouse | gas | emissions | Szép | Sebestyén | 2016 | found | that | the | share | of | renewable | energy | sources | shows | the | fastest | convergence | This | positive | trend | is | negatively | affected | by | the | economic | crisis | Convergence | is | stronger | in | countries | with | poor | initial | energy | efficiency | later | entrants | The | production | and | use | of | renewable | energy | is | also | essential | for | mitigating | the | well | known | negative | impacts | of | climate | change | which | is | expected | to | become | even | more | important | in | the | future | Hollósy | et | al | 2021a

The | EU | has | set | a | target | of | achieving | a | 10 | share | of | energy | consumption | produced | from | renewable | energy | sources | in | transport | one | of | the | most | carbon | intensive | sectors | by | 2020

While | this | ratio | stood | at | only | 1.5 | in | 2004 | in | the | following | years | it | became | much | closer | to | the | target | value | 7.5 | in | 2017 | 8.3 | in | 2018 | and | 8.9 | in | 2019 | Kiss | et | al | 2021 | In | 2016 | the | share | of | renewable | energy | in | electricity | generation | in | the | EU28 | was | nearly | 30 | percent | while | in | Hungary | it | was | only | 7 | percent | the | second | lowest | share | among | EU | Member | States | Csizmásné | Tóth | J. | et | al | 2018 | Installing | solar | systems | in | electricity | generation | can | reduce | the | use | of | conventional | fossil | fuels | and | reduce | carbon | dioxide | emissions | Hollósy | et | al | 2021b | The | conversion | of | animal | by | products | used | in | agricultural | biogas | plants | into | energy | is | also | an | opportunity | for | agriculture | and | rural | development | which | corresponds | to | the | efforts | of | the | European | Union | to | diversify | its | energy | sources | in | favor | of | renewable | energy | sources | Chodkowska | Miszczuk | et | al | 2019

The | implementation | of | the | principles | of | the | circular | economy | supports | the | achievement | of | the | goals | of | sustainable | development | therefore | their | application | by | economic | actors | is | important | and | from | the | researcher | 's | perspective | it | is | important | to | measure | the | prevalence | of | applications | for | which | purpose | a | wide | range | of | circularity | indicators | have | been | developed | by | the | researchers | of | this | topic

We | can | find | a | lot | of | good | practices | but | no | survey | has | yet | been | conducted | that | shows | a | complete | picture | of | the | Hungarian | situation | The | present | study | examines | this | issue | and | analyzes | the | implementation | of | the | environmental | goals | of | the | circular | economy | among | enterprises | also | following | a | territorial | approach

In | section | 2 | of | our | article | in | the | context | of | the | literature | review | we | briefly | summarize | the | definitions | of | the | circular | economy | we | discuss | the | framework | of | the | circular | economy | with | special | regard | to | its | measurable | requirements | which | also | forms | the | basis | of | the | empirical | part

Section | 3 | presents | the | test | sample | and | the | test | methods | used | In | Section | 4 | we | present | the | results | of | our | research | and | in | Section | 5 | we | summarize | them

The | current | economic | system | is | characterized | by | a | linear | approach | The | extraction | of | raw | materials | from | nature | ensures | the | production | of | goods | some | of | which | generate | a | large | amount | of | waste | after | use | Neumanné | Varga | Dani | 2020 | 2021 | The | goal | of | the | circular | economy | is | to | change | this | linear | system | The | implementation | of | the | principles | of | the | circular | economy | supports | the | achievement | of | the | goals | of | sustainable | development | Briem | et | al | 2019 | therefore | their | application | by | economic | actors | is | important

The | topic | of | the | circular | economy | has | also | become | increasingly | integrated | into | scientific | thinking | and | corporate | strategies | Lengyel | et | al | 2021 | Fianko | et | al | 2021 | It | is | a | very | common | topic | in | the | scientific | literature | and | as | a | result | we | can | find | a | variety | of | definitions | from | which | a | lack | of | uniformity | derives | Kirchherr | et | al | 2017 | revised | 114 | definitions | of | the | circular | economy | dividing | them | into | 17 | dimensions | By | definition | the | circular | economy | is | an | economic | system | that | replaces | the | concept | of | end | of | life | the | linear | economy | with | the | reduction | alternative | reuse | recycling | and | recovery | of | materials | in | production | distribution | and | consumption | processes | The | circular | economy | operates | at | the | micro | level | products | companies | consumers | at | the | meso | level | eco | industrial | parks | and | at | the | macro | level | city | region | nation | and | beyond | with | the | aim | of | supporting | the | goals | of | sustainable | development | while | respecting | the | quality | of | the | environment | economic | prosperity | and | social | equality | for | the | benefit | of | present | and | future | generations

Lindgreen | el | al | 2020 | identify | companies | as | key | players | in | the | transition | to | circular | economy | where | the | essence | of | implementing | circular | economy | strategies | is | to | reduce | resource | use | and | associated | impacts | while | increasing | economic | competitiveness | and | having | a | positive | social | impact | Circular | business | models | can | lead | to | reduced | dependence | on | natural | resources | Barbaritano | et | al | 2019 | More | efficient | resource | allocation | and | use | are | expected | to | increase | a | company | 's | overall | competitiveness | as | well | as | improve | social | welfare | reduce | environmental | damage | and | economic | inequalities | Lu | et | al | 2008 | McGregor | Pouw | 2017

Companies | can | turn | waste | streams | into | profitable | ones | Engel | et | al | 2016 | and | the | costreducing | effect | of | an | overall | increase | in | material | reuse | can | have | a | competitiveness | enhancing | effect | due | to | reduced | raw | material | use | and | less | exposure | to | the | effects | of | price | fluctuations | Rizos | et | al | 2015 | In | addition | to | new | job | opportunities | circular | business | models | can | also | lead | to | technological | and | organizational | innovation | thereby | improving | the | overall | well | being | of | society | Sariatli | 2017

The | paradigm | of | the | circular | economy | introduces | a | new | perspective | to | economic | life | where | economic | growth | is | decoupled | from | resource | use | and | pollutant | emissions | as | end | oflife | materials | and | products | are | seen | as | resources | rather | than | waste | The | essence | of | the | concept | is | to | close | material | loops | to | reduce | the | need | for | raw | materials | and | the | need | for | waste | management | Elia | et | al | 2016 | The | recycling | system | can | lead | to | significant | improvements | in | material | use | efficiency | and | can | be | profitable | for | manufacturers | MacArthur | 2013 | The | narrower | the | circle | i.e. | the | less | a | product | needs | to | be | changed | during | reuse | refurbishment | and | remanufacturing | the | faster | it | returns | to | use | the | greater | the | potential | savings | This | also | applies | to | materials | incorporated | into | the | products | labor | energy | and | capital | as | well | as | related | externalities | greenhouse | gas | emissions | water | toxicity | MacArthur | 2013 | The | framework | of | a | circular | economy | is | described | by | Elia | et | al | 2016 | Fig | 1

Figure | 1 | The | circular | economy | framework | Source | adopted | from | Elia | et | al | 2016 | In | the | middle | of | Fig | 1 | there | are | five | main | phases | of | the | circular | economy | paradigm | material | input | design | production | delivery | consumption | and | finally | end | of | life | resource | management | which | provides | the | input | to | the | first | phase | These | phases | represent | the | processes | whose | performance | measurement | is | essential | to | judge | the | circularity | of | a | system

Four | categories | of | actions | have | been | identified | in | the | framework | on | the | right | hand | side | of | the | figure | MacArthur | 2013 | Philp | Winickoff | 2018 | Elia | et | al | 2016 | Janik | Ryszko | 2019 | Franco | García | 2019

1 | Circular | product | design | and | production | this | category | covers | a | wide | range | of | activities | from | eco | friendly | design | to | promote | the | re | use | refurbishment | and | recycling | of | products | to | the | design | of | products | and | processes | containing | less | dangerous | substances

2 | Business | models | the | diffusion | of | new | business | models | such | as | product | service | systems | that | replace | product | ownership | or | collaborative | consumption | tools | which | are | based | on | a | wider | spread | of | channels | between | consumers

3 | Cascade | reverse | skills | refers | to | the | ability | to | build | reverse | or | cascading | circles

Measures | to | support | closed | loop | cycles | may | include | e.g. | the | use | of | innovative | technologies | in | recycling | or | the | cascading | use | of | materials | and | the | support | of | secondary | markets

The | power | of | cascading | use | refers | to | the | diversification | of | reuse | through | the | value | chain | For | example | the | cotton | clothing | used | as | a | second | hand | article | in | clothing | which | would | then | be | transferred | to | the | furniture | industry | as | a | fiber | insert | for | upholstery | and | the | fiber | insert | would | later | be | reused | in | construction | industry | as | rock | wool | insulation

Reverse | circles | in | general | closed | loops | consist | of | two | supply | chains | Wells | Seitz | 2005 | a | forward | chain | and | an | inverted | chain | where | the | recovered | product | re | enters | the | traditional | forward | chain | Antikainen | Valkokari | 2016 | This | requires | cost | effective | high | quality | collection | transport | and | handling | systems | as | without | them | materials | will | continue | to | leak | out | of | the | system | so | building | capacity | and | infrastructure | to | close | the | loops | is | critical

Reverse | cycles | are | not | limited | to | one | industry | they | are | also | cascading | in | different | industries | MacArthur | 2013

4 | Cross | cycle | and | cross | sector | collaboration | measures | focusing | on | building | collaborations | through | the | new | value | chain | even | involving | new | actors | preventing | by | products | from | becoming | waste | through | effective | industrial | symbiosis | A | circular | economy | would | shift | the | economic | balance | away | from | energy | intensive | materials | and | primary | extraction | Reverse | cycle | activities | are | emerging | as | a | new | sector | for | the | reuse | recovery | remanufacturing | and | recycling | of | materials | MacArthur | 2013

The | requirements | to | be | measured | on | the | left | side | of | Figure | 1 | 1 | the | resource | efficiency | cluster

2 | a | cluster | of | material | stocks | and | flows

3 | and | the | product | centric | cluster

It | is | noted | that | the | most | common | aspects | focus | on | waste | disposal | primary | and | secondary | use | of | resources | resource | efficiency | productivity | and | recycling | efficiency

Among | the | requirements | to | be | measured | left | side | of | Figure | 1 | the | 5 | factors | we | will | use | later | will | be | described | in | detail | These | are | mentioned | and | suggested | for | use | by | many | authors | in | their | works | Elia | et | al | 2016 | Philp | Winickoff | 2018 | Janik | Ryszko | 2019 | Kristensen | Mosgaard | 2020 | Kwarteng | et | al | 2021 | Kravchenko | et | al | 2020 | Mancini | Raggi | 2021 | Moraga | et | al | 2019

1 | Reducing | input | and | use | of | natural | resources | The | main | goal | is | to | reduce | the | erosion | of | the | natural | ecosystem | caused | by | current | linear | models | by | creating | higher | value | from | less | used | resources | The | direct | consequence | of | this | is | a | more | efficient | conservation | of | natural | resources | through | the | efficient | use | of | raw | materials | water | and | energy

2 | Reducing | emission | levels | Applies | to | direct | and | indirect | emissions

3 | Reducing | valuable | materials | losses | Implementing | closed | loop | models | for | the | recovery | and | recycling | of | products | and | materials | Through | reverse | flow | it | between | companies | is | very | large | All | this | shows | that | the | sample | on | which | the | analyses | are | based | covers | a | wide | range | of | businesses | of | different | types | and | sizes

The | research | was | based | on | several | groups | of | questions | Companies | were | asked | to | rate | their | environmental | performance | on | a | 6 | level | Likert | scale | The | authors | used | the | Spearman | rank | correlation | coefficient | to | measure | the | closeness | of | the | relationships | between | the | responses | and | to | check | their | significance | level

Questionnaire | testing | was | performed | by | the | authors | with | the | Cronbach | 's | alpha | index | which | is | the | average | of | the | correlation | coefficients | between | items | Based | on | the | values | obtained | for | the | indicator | it | can | be | concluded | that | the | statements | in | the | questionnaire | really | measure | what | the | authors | were | interested | in | during | the | research

Subsequently | the | examined | companies | were | grouped | by | performing | a | cluster | analysis

The | advantage | of | cluster | analysis | is | that | similar | observation | units | are | grouped | together | Molnár | 2015 | This | not | only | allows | us | to | conduct | further | research | using | cluster | variables | but | also | provides | interesting | and | illustrative | with | a | graphical | representation | of | each | cluster | information | about | the | proportion | of | surveyed | companies | in | each | cluster | In | the | course | of | the | analysis | the | validity | of | the | cluster | analysis | was | also | checked | in | each | case | Based | on | the | significance | level | of | the | F | statistics | it | can | be | determined | whether | the | centers | of | the | created | clusters | differ | significantly | from | each | other | It | is | also | necessary | to | examine | the | correlation | coefficients | before | performing | the | cluster | analysis | as | in | case | of | correlation | coefficients | higher | than | 0.9 | the | strongly | correlated | variables | may | play | a | larger | role | in | the | analysis

To | prove | the | existence | of | a | relationship | between | the | individual | cluster | variables | and | the | territorial | location | Budapest | headquarters | -rural | headquarters | we | used | the | method | of | widespread | cross | tabulation | analysis | The | method | shows | how | the | enterprises | located | in | Budapest | and | the | countryside | are | distributed | within | the | clusters | formed | on | the | basis | of | an | environmental | goal | and | whether | there | is | a | significant | correlation | between | the | cluster | variables | and | the | regional | variables | The | method | examines | the | relationship | between | two | or | more | variables | in | the | form | of | percentage | distributions | The | significance | level | of | the | chi | square | statistics | and | the | adjusted | standardized | residuals | were | also | examined | during | the | crosstabulation | analysis | based | on | which | it | can | be | determined | whether | there | is | a | significant | relationship | between | the | individual | clusters | and | the | geographical | location | of | companies

When | completing | the | questionnaire | companies | had | to | rank | their | answers | on | a | Likert | scale | from | 1 | to | 6 | in | terms | of | the | extent | to | which | their | company | achieves | the | following | environmental | goals

Reducing | input | and | use | of | natural | resources

Increasing | share | of | renewable | and | recyclable | resources

Reducing | emission | levels

Reducing | valuable | materials | losses

Increasing | the | value | durability | of | products

These | issues | are | the | measurable | requirements | of | the | circular | economy | framework | already | described | in | the | literature | section

The | reliability | of | the | questionnaire | was | examined | with | the | Cronbach | 's | alpha | index | the | values | of | which | are | given | in | the | following | table | Tab | 1 | The | value | of | Cronbach | 's | alpha | can | be | between | 0 | and | 1 | Scales | with | an | alpha | of | at | least | 0.7 | can | be | considered | reliable | and | stable | but | at | the | same | time | a | very | high | alpha | value | of | 0.9 | can | also | indicate | redundancy | Takács | Kárász | 2015 | Gliem | Gliem | 2003

The | value | of | Cronbach | 's | alpha | in | our | case | is | 0.8 | which | indicates | good | internal | consistency | of | the | items | in | the | scale

The | Alpha | values | in | the | second | half | of | the | table | show | what | would | happen | if | that | variable | were | removed | We | can | see | that | the | value | of | Alpha | would | decrease | in | each | case | if | the | value | would | be | higher | for | one | of | the | variables | the | stability | would | increase | if | that | variable | was | omitted

The | frequency | of | answers | to | each | question | is | shown | in | Fig | 2 | Reducing | valuable | materials | losses

Figure | 2 | Distribution | of | responses | to | environmental | objectives | on | a | scale | of | 1 | to | 6

We | found | significant | differences | in | the | ranking | of | each | issue | suggesting | that | perceptions | of | the | environmental | objectives | are | quite | different | Based | on | the | bar | charts | in | Figure | 2 | our | first | conclusion | was | that | a | certain | proportion | of | companies | do | not | consider | the | degree | of | achievement | of | the | environmental | goals | given | in | the | questionnaire | to | be | high

In | the | answers | given | to | each | question | the | values | of | 5 | occur | in | the | highest | proportion | on | a | scale | of | 6 | There | are | two | exceptions | to | this

the | use | of | renewable | and | recyclable | resources | in | case | of | which | the | ranking | 2 | being | the | most | common

the | other | goal | which | has | a | slightly | lower | value | is | the | reduction | of | the | acquisition | and | use | of | natural | resources | ranking | mode | 4

For | the | other | goals | given | businesses | ranked | 5 | most | often | However | it | is | striking | that | a | smaller | proportion | of | firms | rated | these | elements | of | the | circular | economy | as | being | their | primary | goal | In | the | total | sample | there | were | only | five | companies | that | rated | each | of | the | environmental | objectives | at | the | highest | level | 6 | all | of | which | are | operating | in | the | manufacturing | industry | and | there | is | a | big | difference | between | them | in | terms | of | headcount | and | sales | revenue | difference | in | turnover | is | more | than | HUF | 11 | billion | EUR | 29.3 | million | and | the | difference | in | headcount | of | almost | 400 | people | However | there | was | only | one | company | in | the | sample | operating | in | the | construction | industry | which | does | not | perceive | any | of | the | stated | environmental | goals | among | the | strongly | prevailing | goals | Based | on | all | this | it | can | not | be | concluded | that | the | responding | companies | are | oriented | towards | a | circular | economy | or | not | based | on | their | environmental | practices | Based | on | the | responses | the | authors | of | this | article | used | two | assumptions

Businesses | do | not | place | the | same | emphasis | on | each | circular | economic | goal | yet | well | identifiable | groups | with | similar | attitudes | can | be | defined

There | is | a | difference | in | the | affiliation | to | each | group | between | enterprises | located | in | the | capital | and | in | the | countryside

To | support | the | first | assumption | we | chose | to | use | the | method | of | cluster | analysis | Before | performing | the | cluster | analysis | we | examined | Spearman | 's | rank | correlation | coefficients | during | which | we | did | not | find | any | strongly | correlating | variables | that | could | have | biased | the | result | of | the | cluster | analysis | The | magnitudes | of | the | coefficients | ranged | from | 0.332 | to | 0.595 | showing | a | moderate | to | weak | positive | relationship | at | the | 1 | significance | level

Based | on | the | cluster | analysis | the | authors | assumptions | were | confirmed | as | three | clusters | were | clearly | identified | among | the | enterprises | The | clusters | were | formed | with | standardized | variables | the | expected | value | of | which | is | zero | and | the | variance | is | 1 | so | the | individual | clusters | can | be | characterized | by | the | relative | differences | Based | on | the | cluster | analysis | companies | with | similar | environmental | goals | were | included | in | the | same | cluster | Based | on | the | general | environmental | objectives | three | significantly | different | clusters | were | formed | the | significance | level | of | the | F | test | was | 0 | for | all | three | clusters

In | the | first | cluster | which | was | named | environmentally | goal | oriented | each | of | the | examined | environmental | goals | appears | strongly | which | is | shown | by | the | positive | values | in | the | table | These | enterprises | are | committed | to | the | practical | application | of | the | circular | economy | approach | and | can | be | considered | at | the | forefront | of | other | enterprises

The | second | cluster | can | be | called | resource | oriented | as | for | the | companies | belonging | to | this | group | the | reduction | of | the | acquisition | and | use | of | natural | resources | and | the | use | of | renewable | and | recyclable | resources | appear | as | important | goals | positive | values | in | the | table | the | other | goals | have | negative | values | their | appearance | is | lower | compared | to | other | companies | in | the | sample | In | this | group | the | emphasis | on | environmental | aspects | can | already | be | felt | but | the | economic | organizations | belonging | to | this | cluster | mostly | determine | their | environmental | goals | based | on | the | resource | approach | so | they | can | be | considered | progressive | among | other | companies

In | the | third | cluster | called | non | environmentally | goal | oriented | each | goal | appears | with | a | negative | value | so | they | gave | each | goal | a | lower | value | on | a | scale | of | 1 | to | 6 | than | the | other | companies | in | the | sample | in | general | These | companies | have | not | yet | put | the | environmental | approach | into | practice | as | none | of | the | environmental | targets | received | a | high | ranking | when | completing | the | questionnaires | Based | on | the | analyses | they | can | be | considered | lagging | behind | the | previous | two | groups | A | total | of | 39 | of | the | responding | companies | belong | to | the | 1 | environmentally | goaloriented | cluster | i.e. | most | companies | are | included | here | Their | characteristic | is | that | each | of | the | environmental | goals | plays | an | important | role | on | a | practical | level | so | they | have | already | transposed | the | circular | economy | approach | into | their | activities | Nearly | half | of | the | group | 's | businesses | are | involved | in | the | manufacturing | industry | which | is | not | surprising | given | the | overrepresentation | of | this | sector | However | several | businesses | operate | in | transportation | warehousing | trade | vehicle | repair | water | supply | waste | water | collection | and | treatment | waste | management | and | decontamination | sectors | In | terms | of | turnover | there | is | a | big | difference | between | companies | There | is | a | difference | of | almost | HUF | 205 | billion | between | the | largest | and | the | smallest | sales | revenue | EUR | 54.7 | million | In | the | case | of | the | number | of | employees | we | 39 | 62 | 31 | 59 | 30 | 1 | -Environmentally | goal | oriented | 2 | -Resource | oriented | find | a | similar | difference | the | range | here | is | 37 | thousand | people | All | this | means | that | the | companies | with | the | highest | turnover | and | the | largest | number | of | employees | fall | into | this | category | but | there | are | also | a | number | of | companies | that | are | much | smaller | among | the | pioneers

In | the | group | called | 2 | resource | oriented | we | find | 31 | of | the | enterprises | included | in | the | sample | These | companies | have | identified | the | reduction | in | the | acquisition | and | use | of | natural | resources | and | the | use | of | renewable | and | recyclable | resources | as | a | priority | for | the | business | the | other | environmental | goals | not | yet | being | emphasized | The | proportion | of | enterprises | operating | in | the | manufacturing | industry | is | also | high | in | this | group | 35 | but | it | is | already | lower | than | in | the | case | of | the | pioneers | Companies | in | sectors | that | use | mainly | natural | resources | such | as | agriculture | forestry | and | fishing | were | included | in | this | group | in | a | larger | number | In | addition | as | in | the | case | of | the | pioneers | in | this | cluster | we | can | find | companies | involved | in | the | water | supply | wastewater | collection | and | treatment | waste | management | and | decontamination | sectors

The | range | of | sales | revenues | in | this | group | is | HUF | 117 | billion | EUR | 312 | million | which | is | less | than | in | the | case | of | group | 1 | and | similarly | the | differences | in | the | number | of | employees | is | much | smaller | 10 | thousand | people | All | this | means | that | this | group | has | a | more | homogeneous | composition | and | it | appears | that | smaller | enterprises | have | been | included | in | this | group

In | the | non | environmentally | goal | oriented | sector | 3 | the | share | of | enterprises | operating | in | the | manufacturing | industry | is | even | lower | 32 | and | in | addition | to | transport | and | storage | water | supply | wastewater | collection | and | treatment | waste | management | and | decontamination | a | larger | number | of | companies | performing | administrative | and | service | support | activities | are | also | appearing | The | range | of | sales | revenue | realized | in | the | business | year | is | the | highest | in | this | group | HUF | 342 | billion | EUR | 912 | million | and | the | range | of | headcount | is | the | same | as | in | the | first | group | 37 | thousand | people

Based | on | the | above | it | can | not | be | stated | unequivocally | that | a | large | enterprise | in | terms | of | turnover | number | of | employees | clearly | belongs | to | the | environmentally | goal | oriented | cluster

The | characterization | of | the | clusters | reveals | that | there | are | several | such | companies | in | the | lagging | group

The | authors | hypothesized | that | -as | in | most | spatial | analyzes | in | general- | the | majority | of | enterprises | based | in | the | capital | belong | to | the | cluster | of | environmentally | goal | oriented | frontline | pioneers | However | the | results | did | not | confirm | this | assumption | as | the | largest | proportion | of | companies | with | headquarters | in | the | capital | city | 43.18 | belong | to | the | second | resourceoriented | group | In | contrast | almost | half | of | the | enterprises | with | headquarters | outside | the | capital | 43.59 | can | be | included | among | the | pioneers | in | the | group | of | environmentally | goal | oriented | cluster | Fig | 4 | After | the | cluster | analysis | the | method | of | cross | tabulation | analysis | was | applied | to | examine | whether | there | is | a | relationship | between | belonging | to | environmentally | goal | oriented | clusters | and | the | capital | or | rural | location | The | adjusted | standardized | residuals | of | the | cross | tabulation | analysis | show | a | correlation | between | the | Budapest | based | enterprises | and | the | resource | oriented | cluster | and | between | the | rural | based | enterprises | and | the | cluster | called | the | environmentally | goal | oriented | cluster | A | value | of | +2 | or | above | for | the | adjusted | standardized | residual | proves | the | existence | of | a | significant | relationship | and | for | values | below | -2 | or | below | there | is | certainly | no | correlation | between | the | two | variables | Based | on | this | we | can | state | the | opposite | of | the | previous | statement | that | there | is | certainly | no | correlation | between | the | Budapest | based | enterprises | and | the | environmentally | goal | oriented | cluster | or | between | the | rural | based | enterprises | and | the | resourceoriented | cluster | In | the | cross | tabulation | the | correlations | are | highlighted | in | green | and | the | absence | of | correlations | is | highlighted | in | red | At | the | same | time | it | can | not | be | statistically | proven | that | the | capital | countryside | relationship | determines | which | company | belongs | to | which | group | We | base | this | finding | on | the | following

According | to | the | significance | rule | if | the | significance | level | p | 0.05 | of | Pearson | 's | χ2 | chisquare | statistic | we | can | reject | the | null | hypothesis | that | there | is | no | correlation | between | the | two | variables | In | the | present | research | the | significance | level | of | the | χ2 | chi | square | statistic | in | the | cross | tabulation | study | is | 0.55 | Cramer | 's | V | showed | a | low | value | 0.17 | with | a | significance | level | of | 0.55 | i.e. | the | first | type | of | error | although | slightly | above | 5 | p | 5.5

Looking | at | the | results | we | can | see | that | the | practical | application | of | the | principles | of | the | circular | economy | prevails | in | the | case | of | the | enterprises | included | in | the | survey | However | the | questionnaire | survey | did | not | reveal | the | extent | to | which | they | are | characteristic | and | which | divisions | are | affected | It | is | also | questionable | whether | this | practical | activity | stems | from | the | company | 's | environmental | strategy | or | whether | the | importance | of | operational | efficiency | and | the | company | 's | external | judgment | directs | companies | towards | the | application | of | environmental | aspects

Based | on | the | responses | given | to | the | environmental | questions | it | appears | that | companies | view | these | issues | in | a | coherent | manner | as | the | calculated | rank | correlation | coefficients | generally | showed | moderately | strong | in | some | cases | weak | and | positive | correlations | with | reliable | significance | values

As | a | result | of | our | research | we | classified | the | responding | enterprises | into | three | clusters | based | on | the | application | of | the | principles | of | the | circular | economy | The | 1 | environmentally | goal | oriented | cluster | pioneers | is | the | most | environmentally | conscious | and | all | of | the | objectives | of | the | circular | economy | are | present | The | greatest | improvements | are | in | the | durability | of | the | products | the | reduction | of | material | loss | and | the | reduction | of | pollutant | emissions | In | the | 2 | resource | oriented | cluster | progressives | the | resource | related | objectives | prevail | reducing | the | acquisition | and | use | of | natural | resources | and | increasing | the | use | of | renewable | recyclable | resources | In | the | 3 | non | environmentally | goal | oriented | cluster | laggards | none | of | the | five | goals | of | the | circular | economy | prevails

Based | on | the | net | sales | realized | in | the | business | year | and | the | average | number | of | employees | as | indicators | characterizing | the | size | of | the | company | the | largest | enterprises | were | mostly | classified | as | 1 | pioneers | or | 3 | laggards | The | authors | intend | to | investigate | the | reasons | for | the | inclusion | of | large | enterprises | in | cluster | 3 | in | the | framework | of | further | research

Nearly | 50 | of | companies | in | the | manufacturing | industry | belong | to | the | first | group | which | clearly | indicates | the | environmentally | oriented | strategy | of | these | companies | This | is | mainly | due | to | the | fact | that | the | activities | of | companies | operating | in | the | manufacturing | industry | are | closely | linked | to | and | have | an | impact | on | the | natural | environment

Based | on | the | results | of | the | questionnaire | survey | the | companies | with | a | rural | headquarters | are | the | ones | that | can | be | classified | in | a | higher | proportion | in | the | group | of | pioneers | 1 | It | is | likely | that | these | businesses | have | realized | that | their | territorial | competitiveness | position | will | be | strengthened | if | they | carry | out | environmental | management | Although | it | should | be | noted | that | these | studies | were | not | statistically | verifiable | in | all | cases | In | this | case | according | to | the | authors | by | increasing | the | number | of | companies | included | in | the | research | a | more | reliable | result | is | expected

With | the | rapid | changes | in | the | world | while | the | touristic | demand | has | evolved | from | mass | tourism | to | niche | tourism | products | the | phenomenon | of | slow | tourism | has | emerged | as | a | significant | actor | in | many | aspects | Slow | tourism | destinations | that | focus | on | localness | can | provide | tourists | unique | experiences | with | activities | that | prioritize | preserving | and | sustaining | cultural | heritage | and | historical | values | revitalizing | local | and | traditional | production | and | protecting | the | environment | and | nature

To | consume | tourism | is | to | consume | experiences | An | understanding | of | how | tourists | experience | the | places | and | people | they | visit | is | therefore | significant | Sharpley | Stone | 2011

Slowness | is | a | value | that | leads | to | the | restructuring | of | time | and | quality | of | experience | an | integral | element | of | the | journey | and | the | choice | of | mode | of | transport | that | provides | a | richer | experience | Lumsdon | McGrath | 2011 | 269 | Therefore | slowness | is | an | essential | value | that | also | plays | a | role | in | memorable | tourism | experiences

Encouraging | tourists | to | make | slower | choices | when | planning | and | enjoying | their | holidays | has | several | benefits | for | the | destination | 's | environment | local | people | and | the | tourists | During | these | holidays | which | have | elements | such | as | relaxation | and | recreation | both | tourists | will | have | more | meaningful | experiences | and | the | local | economy | will | be | revived | Caffyn | 2012 | Slow | tourism | contributes | to | the | development | of | sustainable | tourism | by | associating | the | qualitative | experiences | of | slow | tourists | in | the | journey | and | destination | with | the | benefits | they | provide | to | local | stakeholders | Conway | Timms | 2012

The | greatest | role | of | slow | tourism | in | memorable | tourism | experiences | is | its | emphasis | on | localness | As | the | goal | is | to | discover | specific | features | of | a | place | through | its | geography | its | cultural | heritage | or | whatever | makes | it | interesting | to | live | in | harmony | with | that | place | and | its | inhabitants | Matos | 2004 | slow | tourists | explore | more | about | the | natural | and | built | heritage | local | cuisine | traditions | and | some | of | the | special | features | of | the | destination | Caffyn | 2012

Slow | tourism | explicitly | links | the | three | E | 's | of | sustainable | development | -environment | economy | and | equity | Conway | Timms | 2010 | and | promotes | local | distinctiveness | by | understanding | the | cultures | of | others | and | developing | common | interests | between | hosts | and | tourists | Conway | Timms | 2012

The | Cittaslow | movement | founded | in | July | 2000 | aims | to | improve | the | quality | of | life | in | the | urban | environment | by | promoting | slowness | Matos | 2004 | There | are | 287 | slow | cities | in | 33 | countries | and | territorial | areas | all | over | the | world | as | of | June | 2022 | In | Türkiye | there | are | 21 | slow | cities | by | 2022 | and | Halfeti | which | is | one | of | these | slow | cities | and | also | the | subject | of | the | present | study | joined | the | Cittaslow | network | in | 2013 | Cittaslow.org

The | reason | why | Halfeti | was | chosen | for | the | study | is | that | Halfeti | with | its | rich | background | story | and | natural | and | cultural | values | has | a | more | touristic | potential | compared | to | other | slow | city | destinations | in | Türkiye | Moreover | the | fact | that | it | has | increased | this | potential | from | year | to | year | with | the | projects | initiated | after | the | slow | city | title | sets | an | outstanding | sample | in | terms | of | researching | memorable | tourism | experiences | in | slow | cities | Halfeti | has | a | rich | background | as | a | place | that | has | hosted | different | civilizations | for | thousands | of | years | and | where | different | cultures | live | together | In | addition | to | its | rich | natural | assets | and | tangible | and | intangible | cultural | heritage | elements | its | changing | fate | by | being | submerged | under | dam | waters | has | made | Halfeti | an | attractive | tourism | region | The | desire | to | see | and | photograph | the | old | settlements | underwater | the | boat | tours | organised | in | Birecik | Dam | and | the | expansion | of | the | scope | of | these | tours | the | beginning | of | regular | tours | from | the | Gaziantep | coast | of | the | dam | the | inclusion | of | Halfeti | in | the | tour | programs | by | the | local | and | foreign | tour | operators | participation | at | international | tourism | fairs | the | opportunity | to | do | water | sports | such | as | underwater | photography | in | the | dam | canoeing | diving | nature | sports | such | as | bird | watching | trekking | mountain | biking | and | camping | facilities | festivals | organised | in | different | areas | endemic | plants | such | as | karagül | Yılmaz | Güneş | 2013 | movies | and | TV | series | shot | in | the | region | and | reaching | large | audiences | Çiftçi | 2016 | are | the | reasons | that | have | made | Halfeti | popular | in | the | touristic | sense | Various | projects | initiated | by | Halfeti | after | receiving | the | title | of | a | slow | city | also | increased | the | tourism | potential | of | the | district | and | the | number | of | tourists

Although | the | main | purpose | of | slow | cities | is | to | increase | the | welfare | of | local | residents | and | maintain | local | values | and | traditions | initiatives | in | this | regard | undoubtedly | make | the | slow | city | stand | out | as | a | tourism | destination | so | that | the | slow | city | can | offer | tourists | more | authentic | and | memorable | experiences | The | main | focus | of | the | paper | is | the | memorable | tourism | experience

As | memorable | tourism | experience | dimensions | differentiate | in | touristic | areas | with | different | destination | attributes | slow | cities | were | chosen | as | the | research | area

Many | studies | aimed | to | explore | memorable | tourism | experience | components | in | different | fields | of | tourism | such | as | heritage | tourism | Rasoolimanesh | et | al | 2021 | cultural | tourism | Chen | Rahman | 2018 | Seyfi | et | al | 2020 | dark | tourism | Ülker | Demirel | 2020 | winter | tourism | Akkuş | 2017 | hotel | experiences | Sthapit | 2018 | local | food | Sthapit | et | al | 2019 | Tsai | 2016 | The | current | study | will | fill | the | gap | in | the | literature | by | investigating | the | components | of | memorable | tourism | experiences | in | the | context | of | slow | tourism

The | present | study | aims | to | explore | the | components | of | memorable | tourism | experiences | of | foreign | visitors | in | the | case | of | Halfeti | one | of | the | slow | cities | in | Türkiye | By | revealing | the | determinants | of | the | foreign | tourists | Halfeti | experience | how | the | title | of | slow | city | affects | the | memorable | tourism | experience | is | discussed

The | tourist | experience | is | a | complex | combination | of | particularly | subjective | factors | that | shape | a | tourist | 's | feelings | and | attitudes | regarding | the | visit | While | a | part | of | this | combination | consists | of | the | needs | wants | and | motivations | of | the | tourists | the | other | part | consists | of | destination | attributes | such | as | the | facilities | offered | by | the | destination | the | attractions | it | has | and | the | image | of | the | destination | Cornelisse | 2014

Rather | than | the | functionality | of | the | product | or | service | that | consumers | buy | the | feeling | created | by | that | experience | in | their | minds | may | also | be | important | in | purchasing | decisions | Ülker | Demirel | 2020 | Tourists | tend | to | make | biased | choices | based | on | their | past | experiences | Kim | 2014 | The | perspectives | on | past | experiences | touristic | activities | touristic | products | and | the | general | structure | of | the | destination | are | effective | in | the | memorable | tourism | experience | MTE | of | tourists | Keskin | et | al | 2020 | According | to | Zhang | et | al | 2018 | although | MTEs | and | tourist | experiences | seem | to | be | related | they | are | two | different | concepts | in | terms | of | connotation | and | extension | Tourists | selectively | construct | an | MTE | based | on | their | own | assessment | of | the | experience | Kim | et | al | 2012

A | positive | memorable | tourism | experience | MTE | is | defined | as | a | tourism | experience | positively | remembered | and | recalled | after | the | event | has | occurred | Kim | et | al | 2012 | 13

Positive | memorable | experiences | are | crucial | to | gaining | a | competitive | advantage | for | tourism | providers | Coudounaris | Sthapit | 2017 | If | visitors | encounter | more | favourable | and | delightful | experiences | during | their | visits | the | perception | in | their | minds | about | these | destinations | will | be | more | positive | Chandralal | et | al | 2014 | Kim | et | al | 2012 | developed | a | measurement | scale | and | identified | seven | dimensions | of | MTEs | The | authors | conducted | a | cross | cultural | study | to | verify | these | dimensions | These | seven | dimensions | are | hedonism | refreshment | local | culture | meaningfulness | knowledge | involvement | and | novelty | Table | 1 | describes | the | seven | dimensions | of | the | memorable | tourism | experience | scale | developed | by | Kim | et | al | 2012

Table | 1 | The | Seven | Dimensions | of | MTEs | Hedonism | expressed | as | pleasure | or | enjoyment | means | that | tourists | are | very | impressed | by | having | a | new | experience | they | really | enjoy | and | are | excited | about | this | experience | Refreshment | characterizes | the | effects | of | the | holiday | experience | such | as | revitalization | and | refreshment | it | also | includes | the | liberating | effect | of | the | experience | Local | Culture | includes | the | interaction | of | tourists | with | the | local | people | in | the | destination | and | the | good | impressions | they | have | about | them | and | experiencing | the | local | culture | entirely | Meaningfulness | emphasizes | that | tourists | have | a | meaningful | and | important | experience | in | the | destination | and | reveals | that | this | experience | offers | important | opportunities | for | tourists | to | get | to | know | themselves | Knowledge | highlights | that | tourists | achieve | different | cognitive | gains | such | as | acquiring | new | information | and | exploring | new | things | or | new | cultures | İnvolvement | describes | the | experience | in | a | destination | that | has | been | wanted | to | go | for | a | long | time | or | to | participate | in | an | activity | that | has | been | desired | for | a | long | time | Novelty | portrays | the | experience | as | a | unique | one | and | emphasizes | that | it | is | very | different | from | previous | experiences | and | even | the | experience | of | a | lifetime | Source | Kim | et | al | 2012 | These | dimensions | were | later | analyzed | in | many | studies | Akkuş | 2017 | Chen | Rahman | 2018 | Cornelisse | 2014 | Coudounaris | Sthapit | 2017 | Kim | 2014 | Rasoolimanesh | et | al | 2021 | Tsai | 2016 | Zhang | et | al | 2018 | In | one | of | these | studies | Coudounaris | Sthapit | 2017 | The | results | indicate | that | experiencing | local | cuisines | creates | positive | MTEs | and | these | memories | significantly | influence | the | cognitive | place | attachment

Qualitative | studies | aiming | to | reveal | the | memorable | tourism | experience | dimensions | were | also | carried | out | In | one | of | these | studies | Chandralal | et | al | 2014 | who | asserted | that | the | sample | of | MTEs | developed | by | Kim | et | al | 2012 | is | more | oriented | toward | the | typical | tourists | identified | seven | themes | of | MTEs | in | their | study | which | aimed | to | reveal | memorable | tourism | experience | dimensions | by | analyzing | travel | blogs | through | netnography | These | themes | are | local | people | life | and | culture | personally | significant | experiences | shared | experiences | perceived | novelty | perceived | serendipity | professional | local | guides | and | tour | operator | services | and | affective | emotions | Seyfi | et | al | 2020 | found | six | dimensions | of | memorable | cultural | tourism | experiences | Prior | perceived | significance | authenticity | engagement | culinary | attraction | cultural | exchange | and | the | quality | of | service | While | the | dimension | of | prior | perceived | significance | is | similar | to | the | findings | of | Chandralal | et | al | 2014 | the | cultural | exchange | dimension | is | compatible | with | both | Kim | et | al | 2012 | and | Chandralal | et | al | 2014 | In | another | study | Ülker | Demirel | 2020 | identified | ten | dimensions | under | emotional | and | cognitive | dimensions | moving | feelings | and | emotionality | being | affected | and | admired | feeling | lost | and | heavy | hearted | feeling | pride | knowledge | tour | guide | involvement | meaningfulness | novelty | local | culture | As | the | study | is | in | the | context | of | dark | tourism | different | dimensions | were | revealed | while | at | the | same | time | similar | dimensions | to | the | results | of | previous | studies | also | emerged | This | confirms | that | the | dimensions | of | the | memorable | tourism | experience | can | differ | according | to | distinctive | fields | of | tourism

The | terms | slow | travel | and | slow | tourism | are | now | considered | to | refer | to | forms | of | vacation | different | from | the | mainstream | Guiver | McGrath | 2016 | Slow | travel | is | an | emerging | concept | that | can | be | explained | as | an | alternative | to | air | and | car | travel | where | people | travel | to | destinations | more | slowly | overland | and | travel | less | distance | Dickinson | et | al | 2010 | and | defines | a | form | of | vacationing | different | from | mainstream | contemporary | tourism | Lumsdon | McGrath | 2011

Both | slow | travel | and | slow | tourism | ideas | arose | out | of | the | Italy | born | Slow | Food | Movement | Conway | Timms | 2012

Like | slow | travel | slow | tourism | is | an | alternative | to | mass | tourism | that | is | regenerative | through | meeting | the | maturing | needs | of | a | growing | cohort | of | new | tourists | It | shares | the | anti | mass | tourism | goals | of | the | new | tourism | model | but | offers | a | more | sustainable | humanistic | ecofriendly | tourism | product | that | is | a | less | alienating | experience | for | hosts | and | guests | alike | Conway | Timms | 2010 | 332 | Two | forces | broadly | underpin | relatively | new | types | of | tourism | such | as | ecotourism | cultural | tourism | heritage | tourism | green | tourism | and | health | tourism

environmental | sustainability | and | personal | social | well | being | Slow | tourism | is | an | understanding | that | emerges | from | these | personal | and | environmental | concerns | Oh | et | al | 2016 | Matos | 2004 | emphasized | that | slow | tourism | should | be | based | on | two | fundamental | principles | Taking | time | and | attachment | to | a | particular | place | Taking | time | means | having | a | different | perception | of | nature | and | living | in | harmony | with | a | place | its | inhabitants | and | their | culture | Attachment | to | a | particular | place | is | to | discover | the | place | specific | values | of | a | destination | such | as | topography | local | culture | history | and | cultural | heritage | and | to | be | compatible | with | these | values | Caffyn | 2012 | outlined | the | dimensions | of | slow | tourism | and | the | elements | in | each | dimension | These | are | Place | locality | distinctiveness | landscape | heritage | environment | produce | People | community | culture | local | enterprise | cuisine | hospitality | grassroots | reaction | to | globalization | and | is | closely | related | to | the | Slow | Food | movement

Although | the | goals | of | these | two | movements | are | different | they | complement | each | other | Both | are | in | favour | of | local | traditional | cultures | a | relaxed | pace | of | life | and | conviviality | Knox | 2005 | The | Cittaslow | movement | aims | to | improve | the | quality | of | life | of | local | people | and | to | create | visitor | friendly | destinations | It | tries | to | preserve | and | develop | architectural | and | traditional | elements | in | cultural | heritage | oriented | destinations | Nilsson | et | al | 2011 | The | Cittaslow | movement | emphasizes | the | use | of | new | technologies | for | collective | well | being | as | well | as | promoting | the | quality | of | the | local | environment | and | local | production | Miele | 2008 | The | snail | in | the | logo | of | slow | cities | symbolizes | the | slowness | of | the | city | and | its | shell | the | protectionism | Cittaslow | is | a | traditionalist | environmentalist | and | creative | movement | against | today | 's | globalizing | technological | and | fast | city | life | Özhancı | et | al | 2012

The | Cittaslow | movement | has | set | out | with | the | goal | of | an | alternative | city | where | people | can | interact | with | each | other | be | self | sufficient | in | production | have | good | infrastructure | opportunities | use | renewable | energy | resources | and | benefit | more | from | the | opportunities | of | technology | For | being | a | Cittalow | member | a | city | must | accept | the | Slow | Food | guidelines | and | strive | to | conserve | the | local | values | Cittaslow.org | The | population | must | be | less | than | 50,000 | and | meet | the | list | of | criteria | set | by | the | association | Heitmann | et | al | 2011 | There | are | 72 | criteria | subdivided | into | 7 | areas | These | areas | are | Energy | and | environmental | policies | infrastructure | policies | quality | of | urban | life | policies | agriculture | touristic | and | artisan | policies | policies | for | hospitality | awareness | and | training | social | cohesion | and | partnerships | Cittaslow.org

In | the | next | section | information | about | the | district | 's | history | cultural | values | tourism | potential | and | the | projects | realized | after | it | became | a | slow | city | are | presented | in | order | to | better | understand | the | findings | of | the | study

Halfeti | a | district | of | Şanlıurfa | to | the | northwest | of | the | city | is | approximately | 120 | km | from | the | city | centre | and | 90 | km | from | Gaziantep | Boyraz | and | Bostancı | 2015 | 54 | Economic | life | in

Halfeti | is | based | on | farming | and | tourism | activities | Pekdemir | 2018 | There | are | two | dams | in | the | region | Atatürk | Dam | 145 | km | north | of | Halfeti | and | Birecik | Dam | 55 | km | south | of | Halfeti | on | the | Euphrates | River | Özüpekçe | 2019 | A | part | of | Halfeti | has | been | flooded | when | water | started | to | accumulate | in | the | Birecik | Dam | in | 2000 | Then | the | village | of | Karaotlak | located | 8 | km | east | was | determined | as | the | new | settlement | area | Bakırcı | 2002 | 58 | Halfeti | which | was | one | of | the | important | cities | of | the | Commagene | Kingdom | 4000 | years | ago | came | under | the | rule | of | many | civilizations | throughout | history | Pekdemir | 2018

to | the | Municipality | of | Halfeti | As | part | of | Slow | Food | Activities | and | Projects | arrangements | were | made | for | restaurants | in | the | district | In | line | with | the | initiatives | in | this | field | many | new | activities | have | also | been | implemented | In | this | context | as | a | result | of | efforts | focused | on | Halfeti | cheese | this | cheese | took | its | place | in | the | festival | known | as | Türkiye | 's | first | cheese | festival | Apart | from | this | events | such | as | the | Fruit | Food | Festival | and | the | Fragrance | Festival | have | started | to | be | organized | traditionally | are | organized | Göker | 2020

Most | tourists | prefer | the | spring | and | autumn | periods | for | visiting | Halfeti | avoiding | the | scorching | heat | of | summer | Özüpekçe | 2019 | As | of | April | tourist | movements | in | Halfeti | begin | to | revive | and | reach | their | peak | in | May | The | number | of | visitors | which | decreased | to | a | certain | extent | in | the | summer | months | starts | to | increase | again | in | the | autumn | months | Halfeti | where | tourist | movements | are | intense | especially | on | weekends | comes | between | 10,000 | and | 12,500 | on | Saturdays | and | between | 15,000 | and | 18,000 | on | Sundays | depending | on | the | seasons | Çiftçi | 2016 | While | Halfeti | hosted | approximately | 600,000 | tourists | in | 2018 | with | the | effect | of | 2019 | being | declared | the | Year | of | Göbeklitepe | it | attracted | nearly | one | million | tourists | both | domestic | and | foreign | before | the | pandemic | iletisim.gov.tr | Although | the | tourism | activity | in | the | district | decreased | to | 30 | of | normal | due | to | the | effect | of | Covid-19 | in | 2020 | it | started | to | increase | again | as | the | district | was | in | the | low | risk | category | and | the | bans | were | lifted | trthaber.com | However | the | accommodation | period | of | tourists | in | Halfeti | is | quite | short | Since | it | is | between | two | cities | with | high | tourism | potential | such | as | Gaziantep | and | Şanlıurfa | it | is | usually | included | in | the | tour | programs | as | a | day | trip | In | a | study | Çiftçi | 2016 | found | that | 78.7 | of | the | tourists | stayed | in | Halfeti | for | 1 | 2 | days

The | study | aims | to | find | out | the | components | of | foreign | tourists | memorable | tourism | experience | about | one | of | the | slow | cities | of | Türkiye | Halfeti | The | study | tries | to | answer | the | questions | of | In | what | expressions | do | tourists | describe | their | Halfeti | experiences | What | are | the | factors | that | tourists | focus | on | in | their | description | of | Halfeti | experiences | and | How | does | the | title | of | slow | city | affect | tourists | Halfeti | experiences

Netnography | design | was | used | in | this | qualitative | paper | Netnography | first | introduced | by | Robert | Kozinets | is | a | research | approach | within | the | consumer | research | framework | Mkono | 2012 | 554 | Netnography | could | be | called | in | different | terms | such | as | virtual | ethnography | digital | ethnography | web | ethnography | mobile | ethnography | smartphone | ethnography | or | ICT | ethnography | Kozinets | 2015 | Kozinets | 2015 | 2 | defines | netnography | as | specific | sets | of | research | positions | and | accompanying | practices | embedded | in | historical | trajectories | webs | of | theoretical | constructs | and | networks | of | scholarship | and | citation

it | is | a | particular | performance | of | cultural | research | followed | by | specific | kinds | of | representation | of | understanding | In | other | words | netnography | is | not | simply | typing | some | terms | from | the | narratives | on | the | web | it | is | searching | for | a | deeper | cultural | understanding | behind | the | communication | of | people

Netnographic | research | involves | searching | for | and | analyzing | relevant | computer | generated | data | to | address | identified | research | questions | Mkono | 2012 | 554 | Researchers | need | to | identify | specific | marketing | research | questions | and | select | particular | online | forums | appropriate | for | those | question | types | Researchers | should | learn | as | much | as | possible | about | the | forums | groups | and | individuals | they | are | trying | to | understand | Kozinets | 2002 | 63

Netnography | is | also | suitable | for | tourist | research | due | to | a | growing | number | of | tourism | consumers | are | joining | online | discussion | sites | to | post | messages | pertaining | to | their | travel | experiences | around | the | world | Besides | the | number | of | sites | that | are | dedicated | to | travel | experience | message | boards | is | rising | Mkono | 2012 | One | of | these | platforms | Tripadvisor | was | chosen | in | the | study | following | the | strategy | of | Kozinets | 2002 | to | choose | online | communities | which | provides | detailed | and | descriptive | data | on | the | research | topic | Tripadvisor | is | the | world | 's | largest | travel | guidance | platform | as | of | June | 2022 | similarweb.com | There | are | more | than | 1 | billion | reviews | and | opinions | of | nearly | 8 | million | businesses | on | the | platform | and | as | a | travel | guide | company | it | is | available | in | 43 | markets | and | 22 | languages | tripadvisor.com

The | second | step | involves | data | collection | This | phase | was | conducted | during | January | March | 2021 | At | this | stage | the | narratives | of | foreign | tourists | on | the | Halfeti | page | of | the | Tripadvisor | platform | were | examined | Halfeti | has | two | main | touristic | areas | Old | Halfeti | and | Roman | Castle | Old | Halfeti | is | the | sunken | part | of | the | city | Roman | Castle | is | the | historical | area | on | the | boat | trip | route | At | the | same | time | as | mentioned | in | the | previous | section | Roman | Castle | is | one | of | the | old | names | of | Halfeti | Halfeti | 's | Tripadvisor | page | also | includes | these | two | sub | headings | under | the | things | to | do | section | Other | sub | headings | include | narratives | about | businesses | such | as | hotels | and | restaurants | and | they | are | business | specific | evaluations | Therefore | the | narratives | under | the | sub | headings | of | Old | Halfeti | and | Roman | Castle | which | reflect | the | experience | of | Halfeti | as | a | touristic | destination | were | included | in | the | study | At | first | 45 | narratives | were | reached | on | Halfeti | experiences | of | foreign | tourists | Although | negative | reviews | are | a | part | of | the | memorable | tourism | experience | three | negative | comments | were | excluded | because | they | mostly | include | personal | situations | related | to | tourists | and | do | not | represent | a | general | situation | and | are | less | in | percentage | 42 | online | narratives | were | included | in | the | dataset | The | narratives | are | from | April | 2013 | when | Halfeti | was | declared | a | slow | city | to | March | 2021 | when | the | data | collection | phase | was | carried | out | All | narratives | are | in | the | English | language | 35 | tourists | have | country | information | on | their | Tripadvisor | profile | Accordingly | the | distribution | of | tourists | by | country | is | as | follows | United | Kingdom | 8) | United | States | of | America | 5 | Austria | 2 | Malta | 2 | Sudan | 2 | Australia | 1 | Bahrain | 1 | France | 1 | Germany | 1 | Iraq | 1 | Jordan | 1 | Lebanon | 1 | Lithuania | 1 | New | Zealand | 1 | Poland | 1 | Qatar | 1 | Slovenia | 1 | South | Africa | 1 | The | Netherlands | 1 | Ukraine | 1 | United | Arab | Emirates | 1

The | data | were | read | from | the | beginning | to | have | an | idea | about | the | experiences | of | the | tourists | Generating | initial | codes

Coding | interesting | features | of | the | data | in | a | systematic | fashion | across | the | entire | data | set | collating | data | relevant | to | each | code

In | the | coding | phase | 226 | codes | were | found | by | reading | the | narratives | After | the | first | coding | it | was | checked | by | recoding | starting | from | the | beginning | and | some | codes | that | have | the | same | meaning | were | combined | and | 204 | codes | were | reached

Foreign | tourists | who | visited | Halfeti | expressed | admiration | while | representing | their | experiences | and | pointed | out | that | they | had | distinctive | experiences | Sub | themes | determined | within | the | scope | of | this | theme | Enjoying | the | whole | destination | unforgettable | visit | sunken | city | and | recommendation

Foreign | tourists | expressed | their | feelings | of | admiration | covering | the | whole | of | their | destination | experience | Among | the | expressions | stating | that | the | tourists | enjoyed | their | travel | experience | in | Halfeti | and | their | experiences | were | exciting | amazing | breathtaking | heavenly | interesting | so | beautiful | escape | to | heaven | serene | calm | hidden | gem | of | Türkiye | very | quiet | wonderful | 5 | stars | for | its | beauty | worth | the | time | sense | of | peace | impossible | not | to | enjoy | The | feeling | of | missing | the | place | forever | peaceful | unspoilt | impressive | vivid | memory | something | different | a | hidden | treasure | well | worth | the | time | and | money | unexpected | beautiful | village

Foreign | tourists | stated | in | their | narratives | that | the | Halfeti | experience | was | one | of | the | MTEs | in | their | lives | It | is | understood | that | the | attractions | of | the | destination | offer | tourists | a | new | experience | and | this | experience | is | different | from | previous | experiences

One | of | the | best | places | I | have | been | to | in | Turkey | R09 | I | 've | not | seen | a | place | so | beautiful | in | my | life | R02 | I | had | heard | about | Halfeti | from | a | close | friend | and | also | read | about | it | on | the | internet | and | always | wanted | to | visit | and | this | past | week | I | had | the | chance | to | see | Halfeti | It | is | truly | a | beautiful | place | to | visit | and | I | highly | recommend | taking | the | boat | tour | one | of | the | main | attractions | around | the | mountains | and | take | in | the | beautiful | scenery | R14 | I | have | a | feeling | I | 'm | gon | na | miss | this | place | forever | really | beautiful | place | for | unforgotten | evenings | on | a | little | ship | while | sightseeing | R30 | Tourists | impressed | by | Halfeti | both | expressed | that | they | would | like | to | experience | this | destination | again | when | possible | and | also | recommended | Halfeti | and | its | attractions | to | potential | visitors | The | number | of | narratives | that | include | Halfeti | as | a | must | see | place | is | quite | high

All | I | can | say | is | do | not | miss | out | on | visiting | here | R15 | Unbelievable | experience | Is | a | definite | must | see | R13

The | most | admirable | element | of | Halfeti | is | the | sunken | city | part | which | was | submerged | after | the | construction | of | the | dam | which | actually | changed | the | destiny | of | the | district | but | made | it | a | tourism | destination | with | the | projects | Almost | all | of | the | visitors | mentioned | in | their | narratives | how | admirable | it | was | to | see | the | sunken | city | the | mosque | with | only | its | minaret | above | the | water | through | a | boat | tour

The | attraction | here | is | that | the | minaret | of | the | local | mosque | can | be | seen | protruding | from | the | water | R06 | It | 's | well | worth | it | for | a | glimpse | of | the | mighty | Euphrates | and | to | see | the | fascinating | sunken | city | R22 | It | was | stunning | I | could | say | it | was | the | best | trip | in | Turkey | Amazing | landscape | the | river | of | Euphrates | sunken | mosque | and | ruins | and | much | more | R42

Although | Halfeti | as | a | tourism | destination | and | slow | city | offers | many | activities | to | its | visitors | most | of | the | tourists | have | pointed | to | the | boat | tour | as | the | main | activity | to | be | held | here | Tourists | mentioned | the | coexistence | of | nature | and | history | by | experiencing | the | submerged | part | of | the | area | through | a | boat | trip | and | witnessing | its | historical | places | In | addition | the | tourists | who | stated | that | the | boat | tour | is | one | of | the | must | do | activities | here | added | that | it | is | definitely | worth | it

Just | being | able | to | float | along | the | historic | Euphrates | is | well | worth | the | time | and | money | R37 | It | is | really | a | wonderful | trip | along | the | river | and | while | experiencing | the | beauty | one | also | feels | a | bit | sad | seeing | all | the | houses | underwater | R39 | Besides | the | boat | trip | there | are | activities | such | as | hiking | swimming | and | picnic | among | other | elements | that | shape | the | experiences | of | tourists | although | they | are | less | in | percentage

Natural | attractions | have | been | identified | as | one | of | the | essential | themes | that | shaped | the | Halfeti | experience | Sub | themes | developed | based | on | this | theme | are | landscape | flora | fauna | relaxing | and | black | rose | The | mountains | hills | and | rocks | surrounding | the | Old | Halfeti | region | especially | the | Euphrates | River | and | the | landscapes | created | by | these | attractions | are | among | the | most | mentioned | natural | attractions | in | the | narratives | Visitors | commented | that | the | destination | deserves | a | visit | to | witness | these | views

Feelings | such | as | calmness | and | peace | that | these | landscapes | provide | to | the | visitors | constitute | the | relaxing | sub | theme | of | this | theme | and | visitors | especially | remarked | that | they | are | relaxed | renewed | and | revitalized | with | these | feelings | offered | by | natural | attractions | The | rich | flora&fauna | especially | the | black | rose | an | endemic | species | that | grows | only | in | Halfeti | has | taken | its | place | as | one | of | the | significant | elements | that | make | Halfeti | memorable | for | tourists

It | is | beautiful | the | water | is | crystal | clear | and | one | could | really | be | at | peace | with | themselves | and | the | world | R24 | Worth | a | visit | the | landscape | and | setting | on | this | warm | sunny | autumn | day | was | strikingly | beautiful | R29 | I | will | be | back | to | see | the | black | rose | R07

The | history | of | the | Halfeti | region | and | especially | as | a | historical | heritage | Roman | Castle | is | highly | appreciated | by | tourists | The | sub | themes | of | this | theme | are | historical | heritage | witnessing | the | history | and | knowledge | The | history | theme | is | mostly | explained | by | the | ruins | of | Roman | Castle | and | its | surroundings | Visitors | commented | that | they | travel | in | time | due | to | the | attractive | castle | with | its | location | magnificence | view | as | well | as | historical | heritage | value

Roman | Castle | which | dates | back | to | the | Roman | period | and | has | hosted | many | civilizations | afterwards | has | found | its | place | as | a | heritage | that | allows | visitors | to | witness | history | in | their | comments | Some | visitors | emphasized | that | they | got | detailed | information | about | this | historical | heritage | and | made | a | very | informative | visit | as | they | visited | this | place | through | a | tour | guide | Therefore | knowledge | was | determined | as | a | sub | theme | of | this | theme | It | 's | like | travelling | in | time | along | shores | of | Euprat | -take | a | trip | with | a | boat | to | see | ancient | architecture | carve | up | in | the | steep | mountains | above | your | head | R08 | A | beautiful | historic | place | Take | the | boat | to | see | where | historians | think | John | the | Baptist | lived | in | a | cave | copying | the | Bible | and | to | the | submerged | mosque | R20 | You | would | notice | the | diversity | of | history | from | prehistoric | caves | church | caves | mosques | The | word | Kale | comes | from | the | Arabic | word | Kala'a | and | means | citadel | or | fortress | and | the | area | was | home | to | every | people | who | lived | in | or | nearby | this | spot | R27

Another | factor | that | shapes | the | MTEs | of | some | foreign | tourists | is | the | local | culture | The | local | people | and | local | products | emerged | as | sub | themes | of | this | theme | Visitors | noted | that | the | local | people | were | friendly | and | helpful | and | that | this | factor | played | an | important | role | in | having | a | good | experience | In | addition | various | local | products | were | seen | positively | in | the | narratives | of | the | visitors

You | can | be | sure | people | are | friendly | and | kind | willing | to | show | you | their | beloved | Halfeti | R08 | Amazing | I | 've | not | seen | a | place | so | beautiful | in | my | life | The | black | rose | perfume | is | also | great | R02

Foreign | tourists | also | included | positive | comments | about | food | and | beverage | businesses | in | their | evaluations | of | Halfeti | Floating | restaurants | are | lined | up | along | the | river | and | the | variety | of | these | restaurants | and | delicious | food | especially | fish | are | among | the | MTEs | of | foreign | tourists | about | Halfeti | The | sub | themes | of | this | theme | are | floating | restaurants | delicious | food | and | variety | of | restaurants | One | of | the | remarkable | points | of | the | study | is | that | visitors | do | not | include | these | foods | in | their | comments | although | there | are | many | local | flavours | unique | to | Halfeti | except | for | the | fish | species | that | grow | in | the | Euphrates | River | and | are | unique | to | the | region

All | very | interesting | with | several | cafés | and | restaurants | all | along | the | bank | at | the | remaining | part | of | the | city | that | was | covered | by | the | dam | waters | R38 | You | have | to | take | a | boat | and | see | more | parts | and | also | if | you | taste | fish | from | that | part | you | would | never | forget | its | taste | R40 | Not | to | forget | to | enjoy | the | delicious | fresh | fish | meal | and | olive | salad | in | one | of | the | restaurants | along | the | river | R41

The | favourable | location | of | Halfeti | between | the | two | important | cities | of | the | Southeastern | Anatolia | Region | of | Türkiye | Şanlıurfa | and | Gaziantep | which | stand | out | with | their | cultural | tourism | potential | has | also | enabled | foreign | tourists | to | draw | attention | to | this | element | in | their | narratives | Many | visitors | mentioned | that | Halfeti | has | a | very | attractive | location | on | the | banks | of | the | Euphrates | River | between | these | two | cities | and | can | be | easily | reached | by | various | means | of | transportation | Easy | transport | and | attractive | location | are | determined | as | sub | themes | of | this | theme

This | is | a | fun | and | easy | place | to | visit | providing | you | have | your | own | transport | to | get | you | to | Halfeti | where | you | board | a | boat | to | travel | up | the | Euphrates | an | experience | in | itself

This | research | aims | to | reveal | what | factors | affect | the | MTEs | of | foreign | tourists | visiting | Halfeti | one | of | Türkiye | 's | slow | city | destinations | and | to | evaluate | to | what | extent | the | title | of | slow | city | affects | these | factors | As | a | result | of | the | study | the | factors | are | as | follows | admiration | activities | nature | history | local | culture | restaurants | and | location | The | findings | are | also | in | line | with | the | dimensions | of | the | seven | factor | MTE | developed | by | Kim | et | al | 2012

While | admiration | activities | nature | history | and | local | culture | themes | and | sub | themes | are | similar | to | the | study | of | Kim | et | al | 2012 | restaurants | and | location | are | different | themes | specific | to | this | study | Foreign | tourists | mentioned | the | floating | restaurants | in | the | destination | without | specifying | the | name | of | any | restaurants | and | it | was | revealed | that | these | restaurants | are | an | inseparable | part | of | the | destination | Similarly | Halfeti | 's | attractive | location | located | in | the | middle | of | Gaziantep | and | Şanlıurfa | two | cities | that | have | a | significant | share | in | Türkiye | 's | cultural | tourism | and | on | the | banks | of | the | Euphrates | River | emerged | as | one | of | the | destination | attributes | that | shaped | memorable | tourism | experience

The | main | themes | of | this | study | apart | from | admiration | are | the | themes | related | to | the | cognitive | dimension | of | a | memorable | tourism | experience | Among | the | seven | factor | MTE | of | Kim | et | al | 2012 | hedonism | refreshment | involvement | and | novelty | are | affective | dimensions | while | local | culture | meaningfulness | and | knowledge | tend | to | be | cognitive | Zhang | et | al | 2018 | In | the | study | carried | out | by | Ülker | Demirel | 2020 | to | determine | the | factors | affecting | the | MTEs | of | foreign | tourists | visiting | the | Gallipoli | Peninsula | four | themes | are | affective | and | six | are | cognitive | of | the | ten | main | themes | developed | Since | Gallipoli | Peninsula | is | a | dark | tourism | destination | affective | themes | such | as | moving | feelings | and | emotionality | being | affected | and | admired | feeling | lost | and | heavy | hearted | and | feeling | pride | were | found | In | the | case | of | Halfeti | on | the | other | hand | it | was | observed | that | affective | evaluations | are | limited | to | various | expressions | of | admiration | and | feelings | of | renewal | brought | by | nature

The | theme | of | admiration | was | created | as | a | result | of | the | evaluations | highlighting | that | foreign | tourists | really | like | the | destination | experience | are | excited | and | delighted | and | that | this | experience | is | different | from | previous | holiday | experiences | Similarly | in | the | study | carried | out | by | Ülker | Demirel | 2020 | the | theme | of | being | affected | and | admired | was | created | based | on | the | expressions | of | admiration | from | tourists | The | result | of | the | present | study | coincides | with | the | hedonism | and | novelty | dimensions | of | Kim | et | al | 2012

Tourists | mentioned | the | natural | attractions | and | historical | elements | of | Halfeti | and | thus | the | other | two | main | themes | nature | and | history | emerged | While | natural | attractions | evoke | feelings | of | relaxation | refreshment | etc | historical | sites | offer | the | opportunity | to | witness | history | and | gain | new | knowledge | The | point | that | tourists | agree | under | the | theme | of | activities | is | to | witness | these | historical | and | natural | attractions | through | a | boat | trip | Hence | tourists | specified | boat | trips | as | a | must | do | activity | as | the | main | activity | of | the | destination | The | refreshment | and | knowledge | dimensions | of | the | MTE | in | the | study | of | Kim | et | al | 2012 | coincide | with | these | results | The | refreshment | dimension | covers | both | nature | and | activities | themes | in | the | present | study | tourists | can | also | experience | the | feeling | of | peace | relaxation | revival | and | renewal | provided | by | Halfeti | 's | natural | attractions | through | a | boat | trip

The | knowledge | dimension | in | the | study | of | Kim | et | al | 2012 | was | determined | as | a | subtheme | of | the | history | theme | in | this | study | Halfeti | 's | rich | historical | background | greatly | affected | the | experiences | of | foreign | tourists | while | tourists | had | the | opportunity | to | witness | history | through | this | rich | heritage | they | took | pleasure | in | discovering | and | learning | something | new | if | they | were | interested | in | history | or | travelled | with | a | tour | guide | This | result | shows | similarities | with | the | results | of | Chandralal | et | al | 2014 | and | Ülker | Demirel | 2020 | and | the | acquired | knowledge | and | the | discovery | of | some | new | information | can | be | a | part | of | MTE

As | stated | above | under | the | theme | of | activities | the | boat | trip | was | included | in | the | majority | of | the | narratives | as | the | main | activity | and | besides | tourists | also | mentioned | activities | such | as | hiking | swimming | and | picnic | as | an | unforgettable | memory | of | their | holiday | experiences | Apart | from | these | many | activities | such | as | underwater | photography | canoeing | diving | bird | watching | mountain | biking | and | camping | which | are | among | the | significant | activities | of | the | district | offered | for | tourists | could | not | be | a | part | of | the | memorable | tourism | experiences | of | the | tourists

The | dimension | of | local | culture | which | is | one | of | the | dimensions | of | the | scale | of | Kim | et | al | 2012 | was | determined | as | the | main | theme | also | in | the | present | study | Although | the | evaluations | of | the | local | culture | are | less | than | other | dimensions | in | terms | of | quantity | regarding | this | theme | foreign | tourists | commented | that | they | have | good | impressions | of | the | local | people | and | that | they | were | friendly | and | nice | people | Even | if | these | findings | coincide | with | the | local | culture | dimension | in | the | study | of | Kim | et | al | 2012 | there | was | no | evidence | that | foreign | tourists | experienced | Halfeti | 's | local | cultural | values | in | practice | personally | such | as | local | life | customs | traditions | local | production | areas | etc | For | example | as | a | result | of | the | study | of | Chandralal | et | al | 2014 | a | theme | named | local | people | life | and | culture | of | memorable | tourism | experience | was | determined | and | the | authors | evidenced | that | the | travellers | made | evaluations | about | villages | local | lifestyles | markets | farms | cultural | activities | and | rituals | in | their | narratives

In | the | Halfeti | experience | only | a | few | comments | were | made | about | local | products | However | Halfeti | is | very | rich | in | terms | of | both | tangible | and | intangible | cultural | heritage | elements | and | many | initiatives | and | projects | have | been | started | to | promote | these | values | after | the | district | became | a | slow | city | This | result | shows | that | Halfeti | should | focus | on | product | diversity | to | bring | its | local | values | to | tourism | and | make | an | effort | to | transform | its | cultural | values | into | tourism | products | without | spoiling | their | originalities | As | Chen | and | Rahman | 2018 | also | remarked | that | interacting | with | local | culture | and | residents | enable | tourists | to | experience | the | local | life | of | the | tourist | destination | more | closely | which | ultimately | provides | them | with | an | experience | to | remember

A | similar | situation | is | strikingly | observed | under | the | themes | of | history | and | restaurants

The | evaluations | made | by | foreign | tourists | regarding | the | historical | values | of | Halfeti | were | limited | only | to | Roman | Castle | and | its | surroundings | many | tangible | cultural | heritage | items | in | the | villages | of | the | district | and | brought | to | tourism | through | improvement | projects | were | not | mentioned | Regarding | this | issue | the | data | obtained | under | the | theme | of | restaurants | show | that | there | is | no | awareness | of | Halfeti | 's | local | cuisine | Tsai | 2018 | found | that | experiencing | local | cuisines | enables | tourists | to | have | positive | memorable | experiences | and | such | positive | experiences | further | enhance | their | identification | with | or | strong | attachment | to | local | attractions

In | the | Halfeti | sample | the | floating | restaurants | on | the | river | the | variety | of | these | restaurants | and | the | offering | of | delicious | food | positively | affect | the | MTEs | of | the | tourists | but | it | does | not | seem | that | any | local | food | stands | out | except | for | the | fish | species | unique | to | the | region | The | name | of | the | fish | şabut | which | is | unique | to | the | region | is | not | mentioned | in | the | narratives | It | is | revealed | that | initiatives | such | as | organizing | restaurants | and | training | employees | within | the | scope | of | slow | food | activities | initiated | with | the | district | 's | slow | city | title | are | successful | but | the | findings | display | that | more | emphasis | should | be | placed | on | promoting | local | dishes | and | raising | awareness | about | these | values

As | Halfeti | became | a | slow | city | as | mentioned | in | the | previous | sections | various | projects | were | initiated | both | to | sustain | the | tangible | cultural | heritage | and | in | many | areas | such | as | infrastructure | environment | slow | food | and | hospitality | The | scope | of | the | initiatives | could | be | counted | as | increasing | the | welfare | of | the | local | people | improving | the | touristic | infrastructure | and | creating | various | touristic | activities | that | could | attract | visitors | The | people | of | Halfeti | transform | their | traditional | values | into | touristic | products | and | offer | them | to | the | visitors | so | that | both | the | promotion | and | sustainability | of | these | values | are | possible | and | the | economic | welfare | of | the | people | is | increased | These | projects | and | initiatives | undoubtedly | have | a | very | significant | role | in | the | district | 's | being | a | tourist | destination | Before | the | pandemic | the | destination | was | visited | by | approximately | 1 | million | tourists | both | domestic | and | foreign | in | 2019 | Therefore | it | indicates | that | Halfeti | has | turned | the | slow | city | title | into | an | advantage | in | its | efforts | to | develop | tourism | and | has | benefited | successfully

The | narratives | of | foreign | tourists | about | their | Halfeti | experiences | show | that | tourists | have | unforgettable | memories | in | Halfeti | However | in | this | study | it | has | been | concluded | that | the | title | of | slow | city | does | not | have | a | direct | determining | effect | on | the | MTE | Although | some | of | the | main | themes | and | sub | themes | that | are | determined | as | the | components | that | guide | tourists | MTEs | are | a | result | of | the | initiatives | initiated | by | the | district | with | the | title | of | slow | city | there | is | no | indication | that | they | had | an | MTE | due | to | the | destination | is | a | slow | city | It | is | assumed | from | the | narratives | that | the | landscaping | projects | the | coastal | improvement | projects | and | the | arrangements | for | the | restaurants | in | the | district | have | a | positive | effect | on | the | Halfeti | experience | of | the | tourists | However | it | is | another | result | that | local | values | such | as | traditional | handicrafts | products | local | food | festivals | and | traditions | which | are | essential | components | of | a | slow | city | did | not | make | an | indelible | impression | on | the | memories | of | tourists | As | stated | in | the | previous | sections | although | many | projects | were | also | implemented | in | these | areas | after | the | slow | city | announcement | it | is | a | remarkable | point | of | the | study | that | these | initiatives | have | not | risen | yet | as | tourism | products | From | Halfeti | experiences | mostly | natural | beauties | historical | elements | and | boat | trips | are | engraved | in | the | memories | of | tourists

In | the | comment | of | only | 1 | visitor | it | was | stated | that | Halfeti | is | a | slow | city | to | share | information | When | this | result | is | evaluated | according | to | the | slow | tourist | typology | of | Yurtseven | and | Kaya | 2011 | it | is | seen | that | the | foreign | tourists | visiting | Halfeti | are | mostly | in | the | accidental | slow | tourist | category | Their | interest | needs | to | be | aroused | by | general | tourism | promotion | This | shows | that | while | the | district | continues | its | activities | related | to | the | slow | city | it | also | needs | to | increase | the | awareness | of | this | title | Even | though | there | are | awareness | raising | efforts | for | local | people | it | should | be | ensured | that | tourists | have | information | about | this | title | and | realize | that | the | services | they | experience | or | the | products | they | buy | are | related | to | the | title | of | slow | city | This | result | is | in | parallel | with | the | study | results | of | Kürüm | Varolgüneş | and | Canan | 2018 | As | a | result | of | SWOT | analysis | the | authors | revealed | factors | such | as | insufficient | promotion | and | marketing | the | lack | of | awareness | of | the | title | of | slow | city | in | the | district | the | stagnation | in | the | winter | period | and | the | consequent | lack | of | infrastructure | and | service | quality | among | the | weaknesses | of | Halfeti | They | concluded | that | the | strongest | aspect | of | Halfeti | 's | sustainability | as | a | slow | city | is | its | rich | cultural | and | natural | assets | Other | strengths | are | listed | as | having | natural | resources | and | an | unspoiled | environment | geographical | location | and | tourism | potential | As | the | most | important | opportunity | of | the | slow | city | title | the | attractiveness | of | the | Old | Halfeti | area | which | was | flooded | with | the | rise | of | the | Birecik | Dam | waters | was | stated | in | their | study | This | result | about | Halfeti | 's | strengths | is | also | consistent | with | the | results | of | the | present | study

As | can | be | seen | from | the | findings | of | the | study | the | factors | that | shape | the | memorable | tourism | experiences | of | tourists | are | limited | to | the | natural | beauties | and | historical | heritage | elements | especially | the | Roman | Castle | boat | trip | and | sunken | city | In | the | study | of | Özüpekçe | 2019 | the | reasons | for | tourists | to | visit | Halfeti | were | listed | as | boat | trips | 37 | seeing | sunken | villages | and | mosques | 33 | and | visiting | Roman | Castle | 21 | These | findings | coincide | with | the | present | study | However | as | a | tourism | destination | Halfeti | offers | more | than | these | attractions | to | tourists | For | example | under | the | theme | of | history | many | more | historical | heritage | items | besides | Roman | Castle | under | the | restaurants | theme | much | more | local | food | and | under | the | activities | theme | many | sports | and | nature | activities | apart | from | the | boat | trip | are | offered | to | the | tourists

There | is | a | similar | situation | in | the | theme | of | local | culture | Foreign | visitors | commented | that | they | were | very | pleased | with | the | hospitality | of | local | people | and | to | experience | a | few | local | products | However | local | culture | which | is | an | essential | element | of | Cittaslow | philosophy | includes | much | more | than | that | Many | advantages | of | the | district | such | as | local | life | festivals | traditional | handicraft | products | traditional | production | areas | and | traditional | architectural | structure | in | Halfeti | should | be | transformed | into | interesting | tourism | products | in | a | way | that | will | shape | the | MTEs | of | tourists | Therefore | one | of | the | managerial | implications | of | this | study | coincides | with | the | results | of | Chen | and | Rahman | 2018 | Planners | and | managers | of | slow | tourism | destinations | should | focus | on | how | to | promote | cultural | exchanges | and | how | provide | an | authentic | experience | to | the | tourists | through | effective | host | tourist | interactions | rather | than | commodifying | cultural | products | with | a | mass | tourism | agenda | Zhang | et | al | 2018 | 334 | asserted | that | destinations | should | not | only | focus | on | satisfaction | management | but | rather | put | emphasis | on | MTEs | It | is | crucial | to | create | MTEs | every | time | that | tourists | visit | and | hence | need | to | manage | the | experience | differently | to | satisfy | every | visit | and | still | generate | MTEs | It | will | be | possible | to | further | increase | the | tourism | potential | and | to | create | MTEs | of | the | slow | city | Halfeti | with | new | tourism | products | new | routes | new | events | and | projects | that | will | enable | the | local | people | to | interact | more | with | tourists | in | the | district

Slow | tourism | destinations | should | focus | on | which | factors | contribute | to | tourists | experiences | Knowing | the | tourism | experience | and | the | factors | that | contribute | to | MTE | is | helpful | for | destination | managers | as | it | provides | them | with | guidelines | to | serve | increasingly | experienced | and | sophisticated | visitors | Seyfi | et | al | 2020 | Therefore | destination | management | organizations | in | Halfeti | must | first | effectively | manage | the | experience | and | encourage | more | visits | It | should | not | be | forgotten | that | it | is | vital | to | increase | the | length | of | stay | of | the | tourists | visiting | Halfeti | Because | as | emphasized | by | Caffyn | 2012 | the | best | way | to | experience | a | destination | fairly | depends | on | staying | there | for | a | long | time | This | will | only | be | possible | by | increasing | the | awareness | of | the | local | products | unique | to | Halfeti | with | the | emphasis | on | the | slow | city | title | and | creating | new | tourism | products | where | tourists | can | interact | with | the | local | culture

Local | governments | and | other | organizations | should | make | efforts | in | cooperation | with | local | residents | one | of | the | most | significant | stakeholders | in | a | destination | so | that | tourists | can | ideally | experience | slowness | in | the | local | and | cultural | sense | and | leave | the | destination | with | meaningful | experiences

In | this | study | it | was | aimed | to | explore | the | factors | affecting | the | MTEs | of | foreign | tourists | visiting | Halfeti | with | the | netnography | method | and | it | was | evaluated | to | what | extent | the | title | of | slow | city | of | the | district | affected | these | factors | Although | the | evaluations | of | all | foreign | tourists | on | the | platform | between | April | 2013 | and | March | 2021 | were | included | in | the | study | the | fact | that | Halfeti | is | a | tourism | destination | that | has | been | developing | in | recent | years | has | led | to | a | low | number | of | data | The | fact | that | the | first | comment | on | Halfeti | on | the | platform | belongs | to | 2012 | also | confirms | this | In | this | context | the | low | number | of | available | data | can | be | considered | an | important | limitation | of | this | study | In | future | research | more | comprehensive | research | data | can | be | obtained | with | the | data | to | be | collected | from | different | platforms | or | travel | blogs | On | the | other | hand | since | the | concept | of | memorable | tourism | experience | leads | to | different | themes | in | touristic | areas | with | different | characteristics | qualitative | or | quantitative | comparative | analyzes | to | be | carried | out | with | other | slow | cities | may | reveal | more | concrete | findings | on | the | dimensions | of | memorable | tourism | experience | in | slow | cities

Agriculture | is | one | of | the | major | policy | areas | for | the | EU | The | major | roles | of | agricultureprovide | food | provide | decent | income | and | livelihood | for | rural | communities | maintain | the | quality | of | life | sustain | and | protect | the | environment | preserve | the | associated | cultural | heritageexplain | the | strong | focus | on | rural | development | policy | and | high | levels | of | subsidies | increasingly | decoupled | from | traditional | production

Agritourism | is | one | area | where | the | non | traditional | roles | of | the | countryside | come | together | environmental | richness | the | beauty | of | landscapes | cultural | heritage | and | traditional | lifestyles | local | food | and | drinks | and | many | other | aspects | make | rural | regions | attractive | for | recreation | and | leisure | while | contributing | to | income | diversification | The | question | is | whether | agritourism | can | successfully | contribute | to | better | livelihood | and | higher | incomes | or | better | performance | of | farms | -and | if | yes | where | how | and | to | whom

The | present | paper | focuses | on | the | impacts | of | agritourism | revenues | on | the | farm | profitability | and | farm | performance | in | the | EU-28 | from | 2004 | to | 2020 | relying | on | the | standard | farm | data | available | in | the | FADN | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | public | database

The | role | of | rural | areas | is | basically | the | production | of | food | and | of | valuable | raw | materials | but | they | are | increasingly | viewed | as | a | location | for | leisure | and | recreation | where | the | richness | of | the | natural | environment | with | its | varied | eco | systems | landscapes | and | cultural | heritage | traditional | lifestyle | and | farming | practices | coexist | At | the | same | time | these | areas | are | above | all | places | where | people | live | their | lifes | requiring | various | facilities | endowments | services | part | of | which | are | needed | not | only | for | inhabitants | but | for | those | who | come | only | for | a | temporary | stay | Pícha | Dvořák | 2009 | Rural | tourism | is | an | important | contributor | with | multiple | benefits | for | rural | spaces | to | fulfill | their | multiple | roles | Rural | tourism | revitalises | rural | areas | by | attracting | people | and | generating | additional | incomes | besides | farming | thus | stopping | rural | depopulation | and | providing | jobs | outside | agriculture | At | the | same | time | rural | tourism | helps | to | maintain | the | environmental | natural | cultural | traditional | and | historical | character | of | the | countryside | adding | a | sustainable | and | competitive | edge | to | the | tourist | market | of | the | European | Union | Klufová | Šulista | 2018 | Rural | tourism | is | deeply | intertwined | with | farming | which | is | the | traditional | basis | of | rural | activity | and | they | can | mutually | enhance | each | other | 's | prosperity | while | they | may | also | suffer | from | natural | or | financial | disasters | in | a | similar | way | Sharpley | Craven | 2001

Rural | tourism | has | been | analysed | from | several | aspects | focusing | on | tourist | motivation | and | tourist | satisfaction | as | well | as | on | service | providers | their | personal | and | material | endowments | and | financial | position | see | e.g. | Klufová | Šulista | 2018 | Gajić | et | al | 2021 | Chase | et | al | 2018 | Žibert | et | al | 2022 | Lamie | et | al | 2021 | Stanovčić | et | al | 2018

The | importance | of | rural | tourism | a.k.a | agritourism | has | been | acknowledged | in | the | rural | development | policy | of | the | European | Union | and | this | is | represented | by | the | rural | development | subsidies | for | agritourism | purposes | or | related | measures | Žibert | et | al | 2022 | Augère | Granier | McEldowney | 2021 | This | reflects | the | appreciation | of | rural | tourism | as | an | important | contributor | for | improving | rural | living | conditions | and | lifestyles | especially | in | the | less | favoured | areas | LFAs | of | the | countryside | Arru | et | al | 2021 | However | there | are | relatively | few | actual | research | results | to | prove | the | economic | benefits | of | agritourism | Most | of | the | economic | impact | analyses | or | farm | business | analyses | have | been | done | about | agritourism | in | the | United | States

The | reasons | for | this | lack | of | thorough | economic | impact | analysis | are | first | of | all | the | lack | of | a | standard | definition | of | what | agritourism | really | includes | and | second | the | lack | of | reliable | data | Chase | et | al | 2018 | Lamie | et | al | 2021

Farm | and | ranch | stays | have | been | popular | in | the | U.S. | and | in | many | European | countries | The | term | agritourism | is | originated | from | the | Italian | National | Legal | Framework | for | Agritourism | passed | in | 1985 | which | promoted | overnight | farms | stays | called | agriturismo | as | a | way | for | farm | diversification | in | Italy | Chase | et | al | 2018 | Agritourism | has | been | increasingly | associated | with | typical | culinary | offerings | of | the | countryside | as | the | examples | of | protected | designation | of | origin | PDO | protected | geographical | indication | PGI | and | traditional | specialities | guaranteed | TSG | show | in | Europe | or | California | 's | success | in | attracting | visitors | to | vineyards | in | Sonoma | and | Napa | counties | Chase | et | al | 2018

In | many | countries | and | regions | farm | tourism | has | developed | very | successfully | In | Italy | for | example | the | number | of | registered | tourist | farms | in | 2015 | had | increased | by | 60 | compared | to | the | previous | decade | and | in | Austria | 6 | of | all | farms | offer | agritourism | services | In | the | Alpine | region | of | Germany | 20 | of | farms | are | involved | in | agritourism | and | a | growing | trend | of | rural | tourism | accommodation | facilities | is | viewed | in | Slovenia | Žibert | et | al | 2022

In | spite | of | the | mentioned | difficulties | several | research | publications | have | dealt | with | rural | tourism | as | an | example | of | farm | diversification | and | attempt | to | analyse | its | economic | benefits | to | farms | though | with | controversial | results

Analysing | agritourism | farms | in | the | United | States | Barbieri | and | Mshenga | 2008 | find | that | annual | income | and | profitability | are | positively | influenced | by | larger | tangible | assets | more | employees | longer | business | experience | and | more | financial | resources | -which | are | usually | true | for | larger | farms | Bagi | and | Reader | 2012 | also | analysed | USA | farms | looking | at | diversification | and | its | impacts | on | the | economic | performance | finding | that | those | more | involved | in | farm | diversification | tend | to | have | significantly | different | farm | characteristics | including | net | worth | net | farm | income | farm | size | and | among | them | those | dealing | with | agritourism | achieve | highest | farm | household | net | worth | and | have | typically | larger | agricultural | area | Khanal | and | Mishra | 2014 | still | dealing | with | USA | farms | in | 2008 | 2009 | and | 2010 | assess | the | impacts | of | agritourism | and | off | farm | work | as | two | options | of | diversification | strategies | on | gross | cash | farm | incomes | and | farm | household | incomes | finding | that | small | farms | benefit | most | if | they | apply | both | of | these | options | Those | however | involved | in | only | agritourism | perform | better | than | those | involved | only | in | off | farm | work | in | many | aspects | including | gross | farm | income | debt | to | asset | ratio | government | payments | and | total | value | of | production | and | have | typically | larger | land | areas | Joo | et | al | 2013 | examining | farmers | participation | in | agritourism | activities | in | the | USA | evaluate | its | impact | on | farm | household | income | and | return | to | assets | and | find | that | older | educated | and | female | operators | are | more | likely | to | participate | in | agritourism | However | in | contrast | to | the | findings | by | Khanal | and | Mishra | 2014 | they | reveal | that | government | subsidies | are | negatively | correlated | with | agritourism | participation | Their | results | show | that | small | scale | farms | being | involved | in | agritourism | generated | the | greatest | household | incomes | and | returns | to | assets | therefore | for | them | agritourism | can | boost | the | economic | well | being | of | farm | households | although | their | return | is | only | 0.4 | higher | than | of | other | farms | Lucha | et | al | 2016 | did | a | similar | research | on | Virginia | 's | agritourism | industry | finding | that | greater | profitability | is | associated | with | greater | percentage | of | income | from | agritourism | Similar | results | were | established | by | Schilling | et | al | 2014 | for | New | Jersey | in | 2007 | revealing | that | agritourism | has | statistically | positive | effects | on | the | net | cash | income | per | acre | and | on | farm | profitability | The | profit | impacts | were | found | to | be | highest | for | small | farms | while | positive | but | smaller | and | statistically | not | significant | impacts | were | found | for | large | farms | George | et | al | 2011 | found | that | in | California | 75 | of | farms | operate | agritourism | to | enhance | farm | profitability | though | only | 21 | of | them | had | annual | revenues | higher | than | 100 | thousand | USD | Another | research | Wilson | et | al | 2006 | indicate | that | revenues | from | farming | in | this | region | were | only | 2 | of | the | nationwide | farm | revenue | level | Arru | et | al | 2021 | researched | the | economic | performance | of | agritourism | in | less | favoured | areas | of | Italy | Sardinia | Their | results | show | controversial | patterns | and | they | mention | that | normative | constraints | limit | agritourism | performance | namely | that | by | regulation | the | income | generated | from | or | labour | spent | on | agritourism | can | not | be | higher | than | those | of | the | main | farm | activity | However | they | find | that | agritourism | increases | farm | turnover | and | on | average | agritourism | can | generate | 46 | of | total | Gross | Farm | Revenues | in | the | analysed | region | although | individual | farms | vary | to | a | great | extent | Holland | et | al | 2022 | points | out | that | the | lack | of | resources | of | small | farms | cause | them | to | struggle | financially | and | thus | many | of | them | are | interested | in | diversifying | their | operations | to | supersede | their | financial | losses | from | farming | However | Hollas | et | al | 2021 | declare | that | the | factors | that | lead | to | profitable | outcomes | from | agritourism | are | still | not | well | understood | but | farm | size | and | years | of | experience | of | the | host | are | probably | enhancing | its | success | and | besides | financial | benefits | it | has | positive | social | and | cultural | impacts | on | the | rural | community | Kima | et | al | 2019 | found | that | agritourism | experience | positively | influences | food | purchase | patterns | for | certain | commodities | -grain | vegetables | fruit | meat | and | fish |  | Correlation | analysis | is | applied | to | reveal | relationships | between | these | variables | Variable | distributions | were | tested | for | normality | but | the | Kolmogorov | Smirnov | test | rejected | the | normality | assumption | and | the | usual | data | transformations | did | not | help | either | Therefore | nonparametric | correlation | Spearman | 's | rho | was | applied | together | with | robust | statistical | methods | to | test | group | differences | and | relationships | between | variables

To | analyse | the | same | observed | units | for | several | years | i.e. | to | carry | out | panel | data | analysis | the | Mixed | Linear | Model | LMM | of | the | SPSS | software | package | was | applied | IBM | Corp. | 2013 | Landau | Everitt | 2004 | to | identify | fixed | and | random | effects | of | agritourism | revenues | on | other | farm | preformance | indicators | to | reveal | annual | trends | and | separate | relationships | by | economic | size | and | country | In | our | models | the | various | farm | performance | indicators | were | analysed | and | the | unit | of | analysis | was | the | group | of | farms | of | a | particular | size | category | of | a | particular | country | The | economic | size | category | was | considered | for | fixed | effects | together | with | time | and | the | size | of | agritourism | revenues | as | well | labour | force | and | subsidies | received | etc

The | LMM | structure | is | as | follows | Landau | Everitt | 2004

The | dataset | contains | n | observations | n | 17 | years | 2004, | 2020 | for | N | subjects | groups | by | 28 | countries | and | 6 | economic | sizes | for | which | matrix | X | denotes | the | set | of | variables | observed

X(i | is | the | matrix | of | independent | variables | for | subject | i | its | rows | containing | the | actual | observations | for | the | individual | years | Let | 's | assume | that | we | have | i=1, | N | subjects | e.g. | farm | groups | We | wish | to | determine | the | influencing | factors | of | a | selected | trait | y | of | these | groups | for | which | we | have | n | measurements | over | time | n | years | The | standard | format | of | LMM | is | given | by | Seltman | 2008 | Stroup | 2013 | y(i | X(i)B | V(i | b(i | e(i

where | y(i | y(i,1),-----y(i | n | denote | the | vector | of | n | measurements | 1 | n | over | time | for | subject | i | i=1 | N | i.e. | group | i | for | the | selected | trait | of | this | group |  | Source | Authors | construction | Significant | medium | level | positive | correlations | of | at | least | 0.25 | of | agritourism | revenues | were | found | with | economic | size | total | farm | output | gross | farm | income | farm | value | added | per | AWU | total | assets | net | worth | and | subsidies | This | suggests | that | agritourism | revenues | are | higher | in | larger | farms | of | more | land | or | assets | and | standard | output | and | higher | farm | outputs | and | gross | farm | incomes | are | experienced | when | agritourism | revenues | are | higher | Labour | productivity | measured | by | FNVA_AWU | and | net | worth | also | increase | with | increasing | agritourism | revenues

Higher | ATR | is | associated | with | higher | subsidies | too | It | is | worth | noting | that | these | relationships | do | not | exist | in | connection | with | ATRShare | Rising | proportions | of | agritourism | revenue | seem | to | be | unrelated | to | GFI | TO | or | FNVA_AWU | i.e. | ATRShare | may | rise | as | ATR | rises | with | GFI | unchanged | decreaseing | or | increasing | Looking | at | other | correlations | a | few | relationships | are | worth | mentioning | Size | is | strongly | and | positively | associated | with | al | assetand | income | related | variables | and | subsidy | levels | and | the | same | is | true | for | LAWU | and | Land | too | ATR | is | not | related | to | LAWU | but | ATRShare | has | a | negative | correlation | meaning | that | more | labour | goes | together | wit | smaller | share | of | agritourism | in | gross | farm | income

However | these | correlations | are | measured | for | all | data | of | 2004 | 2020 | pooled | all | countries | and | all | farm | sizes | and | as | such | may | hide | important | differences | between | various | locations | sizes | and | times | For | example | the | correlation | between | pooled | economic | size | values | and | agritourism | receipts | indicate | that | larger | farms | gain | more | agritourism | revenues | while | former | research | and | Fig | 1 | suggest | that | small | farms | may | benefit | more | from | agritourism | and | other | farm | diversification | activities | and | therefore | their | income | levels | and | performance | indicators | improve | more | than | that | of | large | farms | To | distinguish | between | farm | sizes | and | to | evaluate | the | patterns | in | time | more | sophisticated | statistical | methods | are | needed

Our | key | question | is | to | what | extent | agritourism | contributes | to | the | economic | performance | of | farms | of | various | economic | sizes | The | various | farm | categories | are | involved | in | agritourism | to | a | different | extent | as | is | illustrated | by | Fig | 3 | -showing | the | mean | share | of | agritourism | revenues | in | gross | farm | income | Size | categories | 1 | 2 | 3 | and | 4 | this | latter | especially | from | about | 2015 | are | more | involved | in | agritourism | having | 1.0 | 3.5 | share | in | GFI | after | 2015 | while | for | categories | 5 | and | 6 | its | share | in | GFI | is | less | than | 0.5 | This | makes | it | reasonable | to | analyse | the | importance | of | agritourism | separately | for | size | categories | -To | assess | the | factors | that | influence | the | size | of | agritourism | revenues

To | facilitate | LMM | analysis | the | variables | were | transformed | to | their | standardised | scores | zscores | each | transformed | value | computed | by | subtracting | the | series | mean | from | the | original | value | then | dividing | the | result | by | the | standard | deviation | of | the | original | series | These | z | score | Source | Authors | construction

The | random | effect | of | year | is | significant | for | all | sizes | meaning | that | there | is | considerable | individual | variance | around | the | modelled | mean | fixed | effects | by | time | Similar | results | were | found | with | dependent | variables | Farm | net | value | added | Family | farm | income | and | Total | farm | output | Net | worth | and | Total | Assets | However | the | sign | of | the | agritourism | impact | varies

it | is | positive | for | Total | farm | output | and | Farm | net | value | added

it | is | negative | for | family | farm | income | net | worth | and | total | assets

its | size | interaction | effects | are | just | the | opposite | i.e | compared | with | size | 6 | the | other | significant | sizes | are | impacted | somewhat | less | that | size | 6

for | FFI | and | TO | the | sizes | significantly | differing | from | size | 6 | are | 3 | and | 4 | while | for | FNVA | NWT | and | TA | these | are | 3 | 4 | 5 | and | for | NWT | size | 2 | at | 0.1 | level

As | the | panel | regression | revealed | Tab | 6 | Model1 | Agritourism | revenues | significantly | differ | by | economic | size | compared | to | size | 6 | the | differences | are | significant | and | positive | i.e.

reaching | above | average | revenues | for | size | 1 | and | 3 | the | highest | value | and | significantly | increase | with | time | However | compared | to | size | 6 | farms | the | annual | growth | is | significantly | slower | for | size | 1 | and | actually | turns | to | the | negative | for | size | 3 | The | total | subsidy | level | is | positively | related | to | ATR

With | a | different | model | structure | Tab | 6 | Model | 2 | however | agritourism | revenues | are | significantly | and | positively | related | to | not | only | year | but | to | total | assets | and | total | subsidy | level | while | negatively | related | to | average | farm | capital | and | the | size | of | agricultural | land | Labour | and | the | actual | economic | size | do | not | have | additional | impacts | besides | the | other | listed | variables

Again | random | effects | are | significant | for | both | model | structures | and | goodness | of | fit | is | much | weaker | 0.48 | -0.49 | respectively | produced | the | highest | z | scored | agritourism | revenue | being | the | only | one | reaching | above | average | revenue | levels | Time | dynamics | of | agritourism | revenues | also | differed | by | size | the | fastest | growth | being | in | sizes | 6 | 5 | 4 | 2 | categories | followed | by | size | 1 | and | changing | into | a | small | decreasing | pattern | for | size | 3 | i.e. | faster | growth | is | experienced | by | those | having | less | revenues | initially | With | higher | total | assets | and | higher | total | subsidies | received | agritourism | revenues | increased | while | higher | average | farm | capital | and | total | agricultural | land | indicated | smaller | revenues | from | agriculture | -probably | having | the | main | focus | on | traditional | agricultural | production | instead | of | this | diversifying | activity

Our | findings | are | partly | similar | to | former | research | results | but | they | also | contradict | some | of | them | The | present | findings | support | the | general | view | that | farm | size | matters | in | the | involvement | of | agritourism | activities | However | while | most | of | the | American | studies | indicate | that | small | farms | profit | the | most | Joo | et | al | 2013 | Hollas | 2021 | our | findings | about | the | EU | show | that | while | small | farms | also | benefit | it | is | most | often | the | medium | size | farms | that | can | reach | the | highest | revenue | levels | This | is | true | not | only | for | income | levels | but | for | the | net | worth | and | total | assets | of | farms | too | Our | results | show | that | larger | net | worth | and | larger | total | assets | are | associated | with | smaller | agritourism | revenues | and | the | medium | size | farms | gain | the | most | in | net | worth | and | total | assets | from | having | high | agritourism | revenues | Our | results | agree | with | the | conclusions | about | Italy | by | Arru | et | al | 2021 | that | the | relationship | between | agritourism | and | farm | performance | is | somewhat | controversial | but | overall | the | medium | size | farms | seem | to | be | most | involved | in | and | benefiting | from | agritourism | activities | The | novelty | of | the | present | study | is | its | long | time | span | and | its | wide | geographical | focus | compared | to | former | studies | that | dealt | with | shorter | time | spans | and | smaller | areas | Another | novelty | is | the | methodology | of | panel | regression | that | allows | for | differentiation | of | country | farm | size | and | temporal | effects | The | results | also | underline | that | the | EU | support | policy | positively | influence | agritourism | activity | which | reflects | the | multifunctionality | of | rural | regions | contributing | to | environmental | sustainability | economic | viability | and | preservation | of | rural | heritage | at | the | same | time

The | present | results | point | to | further | research | directions | One | such | research | question | is | to | do | a | similar | analysis | not | only | with | country | averages | but | at | the | level | of | NUTS2 | regions | As | countries | are | not | homogeneous | regarding | their | natural | environment | regions | different | in | their | tourism | appeal | and | agricultural | suitability | possibly | having | on | impact | on | the | relationship | of | agritourism | farm | sizes | and | farm | profitability | Another | research | focus | can | be | the | comparison | of | the | EU | member | states | by | their | business | environment | Factors | of | the | business | environment | can | have | a | considerable | impact | on | the | performance | of | the | agricultural | sector | typical | farm | sizes | profitability | labour | use | and | involvement | in | agritourism | Control | factors | such | as | average | GDP | per | capita | agricultural | and | overall | tax | rates | labour | and | income | share | of | agriculture | in | the | national | economy | or | the | share | of | less | favoured | areas | in | the | total | agricultural | area | could | be | incorporated | to | the | statistical | models | to | reveal | more | specific | relationships | between | agritourism | and | farm | profitability

The | authors | defined | as | the | basic | population | of | the | research | the | 5,000 | largest | companies | with | headquarter | or | site | in | Hungary | based | on | the | number | of | employees | The | answers | to | the | research | questions | are | based | on | the | analysis | of | the | results | of | a | primary | questionnaire | sent | out | electronically | A | total | of | 4,606 | questionnaires | were | received | by | companies | of | which | 202 | were | returned | In | terms | of | size | almost | 70 | of | enterprises | have | between | 50 | and | 250 | employees | and | 30 | have | more | than | 250 | employees | The | largest | responding | company | has | more | than | 37,000 | employees | 22 | of | the | questionnaires | came | back | from | companies | located | in | the | capital | Budapest | Nearly | 40 | of | the | responding | enterprises | operate | in | the | manufacturing | industry | with | a | very | diverse | range | of | main | activities | Several | companies | operate | in | the | field | of | metalworking | and | the | production | of | metal | structures | as | well | as | in | the | production | of | vehicles | and | vehicle | engine | parts | In | terms | of | annual | net | sales | the | variance | Fekete | Berzsenyi | H. | Koczor | Keul | M. | Molnár | T. | authenticity | Time | pace | relaxation | unhurried | more | in | depth | Travel | distance | speed | mode | low | carbon | and | the | Personal | well | being | pleasure | recreation | conviviality | learning | meaning | enjoyment | understanding | These | dimensions | may | vary | from | destination | to | destination | and | some | elements | may | be | emphasized | more | in | some | destinations | However | the | more | factors | that | can | be | brought | to | the | fore | the | greater | the | contribution | of | slow | tourism | to | the | sustainability | of | the | destination | In | another | study | Guiver | and | McGrath | 2016 | pointed | out | five | themes | in | slow | tourism | The | first | theme | as | Matos | 2004 | and | Caffyn | 2012 | emphasized | is | time | as | opposed | to | fast | The | second | is | conscious | decision | making | that | the | conscious | choice | of | slow | is | an | essential | attribute | of | being | a | slow | tourist | The | third | theme | is | engaging | the | sense | which | is | parallel | to | that | described | by | Matos | 2004 | Enjoying | local | food | and | drink | is | an | essential | aspect | of | slow | tourism | This | benefits | the | destination | and | offers | opportunities | to | mix | with | local | people | The | fourth | one | is | holiday | duration | and | location | As | Caffyn | 2012 | highlighted | one | of | the | best | ways | of | experiencing | a | place | more | deeply | is | to | stay | longer | The | fifth | theme | was | determined | by | the | authors | as | anti | commercialism | as | the | slow | tourism | movement | emerged | as | the | opposite | of | mass | tourism | Oh | et | al | 2016 | determined | six | general | slow | tourism | motivations | as | relaxation | selfreflection | escape | novelty | seeking | engagement | and | discovery | These | suggested | slow | tourism | motivations | significantly | overlapped | with | general | travel | motivations | in | the | literature

The | authors | remarked | that | people | may | not | necessarily | have | a | set | of | motivations | unique | to | slow | tourism | per | se | instead | they | may | be | motivated | to | travel | slowly | in | the | same | way | they | are | for | most | other | modes | of | travel | The | authors | argue | that | the | term | slow | should | be | defined | subjectively | by | individual | travellers | rather | than | that | for | example | all | visitors | in | certain | travel | genres | or | to | certain | destinations | are | categorized | as | slow | travellers | In | another | study | Yurtseven | and | Kaya | 2011 | pointed | out | that | the | consumer | 's | interest | is | a | distinctive | point | to | be | considered | a | slow | tourist | They | categorized | slow | tourists | as | dedicated | slow | tourists | interested | slow | tourists | and | accidental | slow | tourists | Dedicated | slow | tourists | are | open | to | slow | experiences | and | discovering | new | cultures | They | are | educated | and | independent | tourists | They | have | good | cultural | knowledge | and | slow | philosophy | They | have | high | expectations | concerning | the | region | they | are | visiting | and | also | they | enjoy | eco | gastronomy | Interested | slow | tourists | have | moderate | to | high | interest | in | slowness | Slow | Food | and | Cittaslow | but | accidental | slow | tourists | see | slowness | as | a | tourist | attraction | of | the | town | visited | and | their | interest | is | aroused | by | general | tourism | promotion

Since | place | is | a | significant | element | in | the | slow | tourism | philosophy | the | Cittaslow | movement | which | includes | experiencing | all | the | local | elements | of | a | place | attracts | increasing | attention | as | an | essential | pillar | of | the | slowness | philosophy | The | Cittaslow | movement | is | a | Halfeti | is | a | district | that | has | valuable | natural | assets | with | its | rich | flora | and | fauna | especially | the | Euphrates | River | There | are | many | endemic | plant | and | animal | species | in | the | district | Black | rose | is | in | the | foreground | among | the | endemic | plant | species | It | is | known | that | the | black | rose | which | grows | only | in | Halfeti | in | Türkiye | was | brought | from | France | These | roses | grown | at | home | have | become | an | important | economic | branch | Making | a | significant | contribution | to | the | family | budget | of | the | local | people | the | black | rose | also | attracts | the | attention | of | tourists | Boyraz | Bostancı | 2015 | Visiting | the | breeding | farm | where | black | roses | are | grown | is | an | attractive | activity | for | tourists | Pekdemir | 2018

Among | the | main | tangible | cultural | heritage | elements | of | the | Halfeti | region | are | Roman | Castle | Ulu | Mosque | Savaşan | Village | Çekem | Village | Norhut | Church | and | Kantarma | Inn

Roman | Castle | which | gained | importance | with | its | sheltered | position | as | a | castle | city | throughout | history | had | become | an | important | religious | centre | from | time | to | time | Bakırcı | 2002 | The | reason | why | Roman | Castle | is | important | in | terms | of | Christian | history | is | that | Johannes | John | one | of | the | apostles | of | Jesus | settled | here | and | spread | Christianity | here | It | is | said | that | the | Apostle | John | copied | and | hid | the | manuscript | of | the | Gospels | here | while | he | was | in | seclusion | later | on | the | copies | were | taken | to | Beirut | Ballice | 2010 | 329

Halfeti | became | the | 9th | city | from | Türkiye | to | become | a | Cittaslow | member | at | the | Cittaslow | International | Coordination | Committee | meeting | held | in | Kristianstad | Finland | on | 12 | 13 | April | 2013 | Boyraz | Bostancı | 2015 | After | the | slow | city | membership | a | series | of | projects | have | Most | of | these | studies | refer | to | relatively | short | time | periods | of | only | a | few | years | focusing | on | one | country | or | a | particular | geographical | region | Our | paper | looks | at | a | 17 | year | long | time | span | 2004 | 2020 | and | 28 | countries | the | member | states | of | the | EU | with | the | UK | using | a | database | derived | from | an | extremely | large | sample | of | farms | The | same | database | has | been | successfully | utilised | to | analyse | farm | profitability | in | the | EU | focusing | on | sustainability | issues | Grzelak | 2022 | but | not | for | agritourism | Financial | impacts | of | agritourism | in | the | EU | is | still | a | rather | underrepresented | area | therefore | the | present | study | can | reveal | new | features | and | relationships | about | it

The | analysis | uses | secondary | data | available | from | the | FADN | Public | Database | FADN | 2022 | EC | 2021 | for | the | time | period | 2004 | 2020 | The | data | are | available | for | each | year | and | each | member | state | as | mean | values | for | farms | belonging | to | six | categories | of | economic | size | see | Tab.1 | Therefore | we | have | 17 | years | of | data | for | up | to | 6 | size | categories | and | 28 | countries | adding | up | to | 2594 | subjects | to | the | analysis | for | some | countries | not | all | years | or | not | all | size | categories | are | relevant | Variables | selected | for | the | analysis | are | listed | in | Tab.1 | -V(i | n | q | matrix | of | q | variables | and | n | observations | for | group | i | representing | variables | having | a | random | effect | on | group | i

-B | a | p | 1 | vector | of | regression | parameters | fixed | for | all | groups

b(i | q | 1 | vector | of | subject | specific | regression | parameters

e(i | n | 1 | vector | representing | random | effects | and | errors | for | group | i.

This | model | was | applied | to | answer | the | following | research | questions

-Does | the | level | of | agritourism | revenues | influence | farm | profitability | and | income

-Does | the | effect | of | agritourism | on | profitability | differ | by | size | categories

-Does | the | effect | of | agritourism | revenues | change | by | time

-Does | the | involvement | in | agritourism | differ | by | country | and | economic | size | and | does | it | change | with | time

-Is | there | a | relationship | between | agritourism | revenues | and | received | subsidies

The | analyses | are | done | using | SPSS | 22.0 | IBM | Corp | 2013 | and | MS | Excel-2013

Descriptive | analysis | of | the | 2004 | 2020 | time | period | by | economic | size | categories

Tab | 2 | lists | the | mean | values | of | selected | indicators | for | all | years | countries | and | economic | sizes

The | mean | values | standard | deviations | and | coefficients | of | variation | CV% | widely | differ | by | economic | size | categories | as | is | shown | in | Fig | 1 | Variation | is | extremely | high | the | CV | values | vary | between | 83 | and | 370 | Except | for | agritourism | related | variables | it | is | only | category | 6 | -and | occassionally | category | 5 | -that | Bacsi | Z. | Szálteleki | P.

160 | produce | higher | values | than | 100 | i.e. | the | all | sizes | average | Category | 6 | has | strikingly | high | values | 300 | of | the | mean | or | higher | regarding | the | actual | economic | size | the | total | labour | force | LAWU | total | agricultural | land | and | total | farm | output | The | same | is | true | for | the | various | income | related | indicators | and | subsidy | values | Indicators | related | to | agritourism | revenue | are | highest | for | category | 3 | The | absolute | value | of | agritourism | revenue | is | nearly | as | high | in | category | 6 | as | in | category | 3 | but | regarding | its | share | in | GFI | the | smaller | size | farms | have | higher | values | than | the | large | ones | As | the | LMM | parameters | and | significance | levels | show | the | economic | size | and | the | year | have | positive | fixed | effects | on | all | the | farm | performance | indicators | while | the | interaction | of | size | with | year | showed | significant | negative | fixed | effects | The | model | uses | the | largest | farm | size | category | as | the | baseline | and | the | fixed | effects | can | be | interpreted | as | is | described | by | the | following | equation | for | the | example | of | z | scored | GFI | as | dependent | variable

z | GFI | SC=6 | -52.5622 | 0.0270 | Year | +0.1361 | z | ATR

For | other | size | categories | the | given | fixed | effect | estimate | values | modify | the | coefficients | when | significant | as | for | example | the | equation | for | Size | 4 | is

z | GFI | SC=4 | -52.5622 | 53.3251 | 0.0270 | -0.0276 | Year | 0.1361 | -0,1351 | z | ATR | This | gives | us | for | z | GFI | size6 | in | Year=2004 | an | equation | with | intercept | 1.585 | meaning | that | its | value | in | 2004 | is | 1.585 | and | similarly | in | 2020 | it | is | 2.017 | with | zero | z | ATR | as | each | year | the | z | GFI | increases | by | 0.0270 | i.e. | GFI | increases | by | 2.7 | of | its | standard | deviation | and | with | 1 | unit | increase | in | z | ATR | i.e. | 1 | unit | standard | deviation | increase | in | ATR | z | GFI | increases | by | 0.1361.units | i.e. | GFI | grows | by | 13.61 | standard | deviation

For | the | smaller | economic | sizes | the | starting | value | at | year | 0 | is | defined | by | higher | intercepts | -52.5622 | plus | the | estimated | value | for | the | relevant | size | but | the | relevant | slopes | with | year | are | much | smaller | 0.0270 | plus | the | negative | estimate | for | the | relevant | size | year | interaction | which | means | that | for | size | 5 | and | 6 | the | slope | remains | positive | for | size | 1 | zero | and | for | sizes | 2 | 3 | 4 | it | is | negative | The | impact | of | agritourism | revenue | is | significant | and | positive | for | size | 6 | while | size | 1 | and | 2 | do | not | differ | from | it | significantly | i.e. | they | experience | the | same | impact | as | size | 6

The | impact | is | significantly | different | for | sizes | 3 | 4 | and | 5 | but | smaller | size | 4 | having | the | smallest | but | still | positive | impact | followed | by | size | 3 | then | size | 5 | These | results | seem | somewhat | contradictory | to | the | message | from | Fig | 3 | but | Fig | 3 | does | not | measure | the | absolute | impact | of | agritourism | revenue | but | its | proportion | to | GFI | with | decreasing | importance | for | sizes | 3 | 2 | 1 | 4 | -5 | 6 | the | different | order | reflecting | the | different | levels | of | GFI | which | is | much | higher | for | higher | sizes | that | for | smaller | ones

Our | results | show | that | farm | economic | size | matters | with | regard | to | the | importance | of | agritourism | in | farm | economic | performance

As | we | proved | for | 28 | EU | countries | and | 6 | farm | size | categories | smaller | farms | rely | to | more | extent | on | agritourism | revenues | the | share | of | agritourism | in | GFI | ranges | from | 1.0 | to | 3.5 | -4

for | sizes | 1 | 2 | and | 3 | while | for | sizes | 5 | and | 6 | it | remains | under | 0.5 | The | results | show | that | the | highest | share | is | however | not | in | the | smallest | size | category | but | for | category | 3 | 25000 | 50000 | EUR | annual | standard | output | Probably | this | size | category | possesses | sufficient | assets | labour | amenities | to | provide | for | better | services | to | tourists | therefore | it | is | capable | of | gaining | higher | revenues | compared | to | other | components | of | GFI

Impacts | of | total | agritourism | revenues | on | farm | incomes | output | and | assets | also | differ | by | size | Agritourism | revenues | impacted | similarly | the | incomes | and | outputs | of | farms | belonging | to | size | 6 | and | sizes | 1 | 2 | i.e. | the | largest | category | and | the | two | smallest | one | They | experienced | the | highest | positive | impacts | on | GFI | while | sizes | 3 | 4 | 5 | differed | from | these | and | from | each | other | too | with | the | smallest | benefits | in | absolute | values | experienced | by | size | 4 | and | 3 | Net | worth | Total | assets | experienced | negative | impacts | i.e. | smaller | values | for | those | having | higher | agritourism | revenues | sizes | 6 | and | 1 | 2 | At | the | same | time | sizes | 4 | and | 5 | reacted | positively | to | higher | agritourism | revenues | Size | 3 | was | also | negatively | impacted | but | to | a | lesser | extent | than | 6 | 1 | and | 2 | It | is | interesting | to | see | that | while | their | income | gains | were | lower | their | gains | in | net | worth | and | assets | were | higher | -it | may | be | related | to | spending | more | on | farm | improvements | and | having | different | investment | strategies

Generally | all | farm | size | categories | differ | by | their | temporal | dynamics | the | fastest | growth | in | revenues | and | other | performance | indicators | is | experienced | by | size | 6 | the | largest | category | followed | by | size | 5 | then | size | 1 | size | 4 | and | finally | sizes | 3 | and | 4 | showing | the | slowest | growth | with | time | This | means | that | small | farms | grow | faster | than | medium | size | farms | which | gives | them | possibility | for | catching | up | and | develop | while | the | two | largest | categories | keep | their | advantage | probably | due | to | different | management | and | organisation | strategies | better | access | to | markets | and | external | resources | while | possessing | more | internal | resources | and | abilities | as | well

Regarding | the | factors | influencing | the | level | of | agritourism | performance | i.e. | the | size | of | revenues | arising | from | agritourism | farm | size | categories | differed | again | Belonging | to | size | categories | 6 | 5 | 4 | and | 2 | meant | actually | smaller | agritourism | revenues | than | size | 1 | but | all | these | categories | produced | negative | z | ATR | i.e. | below | average | agritourism | revenues | and | size | 3
