Compensating | land | managers | for | the | provision | of | public | goods | is | currently | one | of | the | European | Union | 's | flagship | policies | and | one | that | that | resonates | across | the | globe | more | generally | in | the | effort | to | meet | Sustainable | Development | Goals | Despite | having | been | central | to | the | EU | 's | Common | Agricultural | Policy | CAP | for | several | decades | now | Agri | Environment | Schemes | AES | seem | to | only | have | had | limited | success | in | preserving | biodiversity | and | providing | environmental | benefits | due | among | other | to | farmer | related | factors | This | paper | systematically | reviews | and | quantifies | for | the | first | time | the | body | of | evidence | that | explores | these | factors | with | respect | to | their | influence | on | land | managers | willingness | to | accept | WTA | compensation | for | the | delivery | of | biodiversity | and | environmental | features | protection | Our | analysis | shows | a | complex | and | nuanced | picture | Farmers | appear | generally | willing | to | enrol | in | AES | with | average | payment | per | hectare | being | around | 327 | Euros | However | the | current | evidence | base | provides | few | clues | on | how | best | that | willingness | is | matched | by | contract | design | formats | and | features | more | generally | Providing | support | to | farmers | and | exploring | new | ways | of | monitoring | compliance | emerge | as | issues | worth | considering | as | means | of | determining | compensation | in | AES | Further | the | broader | evidence | base | seems | to | suggest | that | wealthier | land | managers | stand | to | gain | more | than | less | wealthy | in | enroling | in | AES | However | this | alone | seems | in | the | overall | like | a | quite | modest | contribution | from | the | body | of | evidence | to | inform | policy | design | more | broadly | It | indeed | does | seem | that | we | academia | and/or | policy | are | not | yet | hitting | the | right | key | on | how | to | best | match | farmers | preferences | for | enroling | in | AES | for | the | delivery | of | biodiversity | environmental | features | A | significant | leap | forward | would | not | simply | require | an | increased | quantity | of | primary | studies | but | a | deeper | reflexion | on | how | the | complexity | of | farmers | preferences | is | best | captured | in | the | design | of | policy | instruments | that | have | to | both | share | common | features | while | being | adaptable | to | context | dependent | characteristics | at | the | landscape | level | This | is | more | pressing | than | ever | face | to | the | unprecedented | challenges | of | Brexit | and | the | COVID19 | induced | economic | recession | which | is | going | to | put | every | cent | of | public | funding | under | the | hardest | of | scrutinies | in | the | years | to | come

Agri | Environment | Schemes | AES | have | been | mainstreamed | in | agricultural | policies | across | the | globe | as | a | means | to | financially | incentivise | farmers | to | undertake | nature | protecting | activities | and | to | support | rural | development | and | mitigate | environmental | damage | Prager | 2015 | At | their | core | they | aim | to | compensate | land | managers | for | additional | costs | and | income | foregone | incurred | in | abiding | with | higher | environmental | and | ecological | quality | standards

AES | focusing | in | enhancing | the | environment | and | organic | farming | were | formally | introduced | in | the | European | Union | EU | in | 1985 | as | part | of | the | Agricultural | Structures | Regulation | Batáry | et | al | 2015 | Since | they | became | compulsory | for | all | European | Union | Member | states | in | 1992 | Batáry | et | al | 2015 | AES | have | been | progressively | reinforced | through | the | various | reforms | of | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | CAP | especially | that | of | 2009 | Wynne | Jones | 2013 | and | can | now | be | considered | to | be | very | solidly | established | in | European | environmental | policy | Over | a | quarter | of | all | Utilised | Agricultural | Area | UAA | in | 2013 | in | Europe | was | under | some | type | of | AES | while | for | 2020 | the | target | was | that | 22.5 | of | all | UAA | 44 | million | hectares | Eurostat | 2017 | is | enroled | in | AES | These | figures | vary | greatly | across | countries | though | For | example | Finland | had | more | than | 93.7 | of | its | UAA | enroled | in | AES | in | 2013 | while | Greece | had | only | 1.8 | Between | 2007 | and | 2013 | 23 | billion | were | devoted | to | AES | in | the | EU | rising | to | 25 | billion | for | the | current | period | of | 2014 | -2020 | European | Union | 2013 | Acknowledging | the | need | of | countries | to | manage | their | agricultural | expenditure | according | to | their | specific | priorities | in | the | current | CAP | the | EU | also | allowed | up | to | 15 | of | total | allocated | funding | to | be | transferred | between | pillars | European | Union | 2013 | This | can | push | a | country | 's | AES | expenditure | up | to | 30 | of | the | total | CAP | expenditure | the | highest | amount | in | EU | history

With | each | CAP | reform | came | changes | in | the | design | and | requirement | of | AES | with | the | most | recent | ones | emerged | as | part | of | the | Rural | Development | Plans | RDP | in | 2013 | Regulation | No | 1305/2013 | Article | 28 | Measure | 10 | The | RDPs | were | primarily | focused | in | the | preservation | of | biodiversity | and | protection | of | natural | resources | European | Network | for | Rural | Development | 2015 | Under | biodiversity | safeguarding | RDPs | included | wetland | protection | protection | against | invasive | species | conservation | of | priority | species | and | grassland | restoration | amongst | others | Preservation | of | natural | resources | refer | to | protection | from | soil | erosion | improvement | of | water | quality | and | reduction | of | fertiliser | and | pesticide | use | Overall | 70 | RDPs | had | a | biodiversity | related | objective | 67 | had | a | landscape | preservation | objective | and | 64 | a | water | quality | enhancement | objective | This | reinforced | policy | focus | on | biodiversity | protection | awaken | the | academic | interest | and | led | to | the | publication | of | several | studies | that | examined | farmers | preferences | for | existing | or | hypothetical | AES | These | studies | have | focused | on | compensation | offered | to | farmers | participating | in | AES | the | characteristics | of | the | contracts | and | the | effect | that | farmers | sociodemographic | characteristic | or | the | geographical | characteristics | of | the | area | had | on | acceptability | of | the | schemes | e.g. | Schulz | et | al | 2014

Despite | their | 35 | years | of | history | AES | in | the | European | Union | seem | to | have | had | limited | success | in | providing | environmental | benefits | Uthes | and | Matzdorf | 2013 | Reasons | behind | this | limited | success | are | varied | and | of | different | nature | While | a | large | part | of | this | would | be | related | to | ecological | effectiveness | European | Environment | Agency | 2015 | Hellerstein | 2017 | some | of | this | limited | success | has | been | explained | on | an | economic | basis | For | example | the | fixed | nature | of | economic | costs | such | as | the | procurement | of | specialist | equipment | or | advice | before | enroling | in | a | contract | has | been | found | to | act | as | a | barrier | to | entry | for | small | farmers | Ducos | et | al | 2009 | while | implementation | and | administration | costs | and | payment | uncertainty | after | enroling | in | a | scheme | have | also | been | shown | to | impede | adoption | Bartkowski | et | al | 2021 | Such | economic | barriers | also | revolve | around | the | changing | or | abandoning | of | past | land | use | activities | which | results | in | higher | opportunity | costs | for | land | managers | Schou | et | al | 2020 | Other | reasons | seem | to | be | related | to | wrongful | applications | by | which | countries | may | have | implemented | AES | that | are | best | suited | for | contexts | with | different | climate | than | their | own | Batáry | et | al | 2015 | limiting | AES | success | on | the | ground | Other | reasons | are | related | to | farmers | preferences | Dessart | et | al | 2019 | suggest | that | dispositional | e. | g. | environmentalism | risk | perceptions | etc | social | e.g. | inter | personal | relationships | and | cognitive | e.g. | knowledge | and | competences | motivations | affect | farmers | adoption | of | environmental | schemes | Farmers | have | also | been | found | to | prefer | simple | but | sometimes | less | effective | AES | that | result | in | limited | biodiversity | support | Dicks | et | al | 2014 | Villanueva | et | al | 2015 | Participating | in | low | risk | low | result | schemes | might | not | be | enough | to | produce | necessary | changes | in | the | agricultural | landscape | Dobbs | and | Pretty | 2008 | For | example | simple | schemes | in | the | Netherlands | do | not | seem | to | have | achieved | high | levels | of | biodiversity | conservation | or | restoration | Kleijn | et | al | 2004 | while | conservation | statuses | of | protected | habitats | show | declining | biodiversity | rates | in | areas | under | AES | European | Environment | Agency | 2015 | Also | biodiversity | enhancing | AES | have | been | found | to | increase | adoption | and | knowledge | of | good | farming | practices | Herzon | and | Mikk | 2007 | Okumah | et | al | 2018 | which | should | be | an | incentive | for | farmers | to | enrol | to | biodiversity | supporting | AES | nevertheless | land | managers | have | been | found | to | be | reluctant | to | change | their | pre | existing | farming | practices | Fleury | et | al | 2015 | Matzdorf | and | Lorenz | 2010 | Finally | sociodemographic | characteristics | such | as | farm | size | farmer | age | and | previously | received | training | also | affect | adoption | of | AES | Villanueva | at | al | 2017

At | the | heart | of | some | of | these | reasons | are | the | factors | that | make | farmers | more | or | less | inclined | to | adopt | the | schemes | and | accept | compensation | for | the | delivery | of | conservation | or | environmental | features | There | is | a | body | of | empirical | studies | that | have | addressed | this | matter | in | specific | locations | or | across | countries | by | surveying | land | managers | preferences | for | enroling | in | such | AES | schemes | based | on | the | neoclassical | economics | notion | of | willingness | to | accept | WTA | monetary | compensation | for | participation | e.g. | Villanueva | et | al | 2015 | Hasler | et | al | 2019 | However | there | has | not | yet | been | a | systematic | inspection | of | this | evidence | which | can | draw | an | overall | picture | to | inform | further | policy | design | into | more | effective | and | successful | accomplishment | of | AES | environmental | goals | In | this | paper | we | present | such | a | review | in | the | form | of | a | systematic | review | and | meta | analysis | of | primary | valuation | studies | addressing | farmers | WTA | participation | in | AES | on | the | basis | of | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | While | qualitative | reviews | exist | e.g. | Lastra | Bravo | et | al | 2015 | to | our | knowledge | this | is | the | first | systematic | quantitative | analysis | We | focus | both | on | farmers | and | foresters | as | they | are | both | eligible | to | enrol | in | AES | and | we | look | at | AES | contractual | characteristics | such | as | length | of | contracts | offered | scientific | support | to | land | managers | and | monitoring | of | results | as | well | as | the | socio | demographic | characteristics | of | land | managers | surveyed | climatic | conditions | and | how | widespread | is | the | use | of | AES | in | agriculture | in | the | country | of | the | study | We | first | draw | a | descriptive | picture | of | this | evidence | and | we | then | look | for | the | effect | that | these | factors | have | in | farmers | WTA | monetary | compensation | from | such | schemes | using | a | meta | regression | function

We | focus | on | European | studies | as | it | allows | deriving | multi | country | comparisons | which | share | a | common | framing | i.e. | that | of | the | CAP | Having | a | narrow | scope | also | allows | for | higher | confidence | when | choosing | a | measurable | indicator | variable | in | meta | analyses | It | should | be | noticed | however | that | similar | AES | policies | have | been | implemented | in | other | contexts | For | example | the | Australian | Environmental | Stewardship | Program | uses | market | based | incentives | for | farmers | to | achieve | restoration | and | rehabilitation | of | biodiversity | since | mid-2007 | Ansell | et | al | 2016a | Ansell | et | al | 2016b | Also | in | the | United | States | monetary | incentives | have | been | given | to | farmers | since | 1985 | to | retire | land | from | production | for | environmental | conservation | policies | Stubbs | 2014 | Understanding | whether | the | current | design | of | AES | and | compensation | offered | to | farmers | is | enough | for | them | to | support | such | schemes | should | inform | the | future | design | of | AES | especially | in | light | of | the | renewal | of | CAP | in | 2021 | and | face | to | the | new | challenges | brought | by | Brexit | European | Commission | 2018a | 2018b | Despite | this | European | focus | results | are | expected | to | be | of | broader | relevance | since | the | notion | of | AES | is | widespread | across | the | world | either | under | this | or | other | framings | Schomers | and | Matzdorf | 2013 | with | biodiversity | oriented | AES | being | the | most | common | globally | Ansell | et | al | 2015 | Furthermore | AES | are | key | in | local | actions | of | land | managers | that | either | directly | or | indirectly | align | with | most | land | related | Sustainable | Development | Goals | SDGs | Mann | et | al | 2018 | as | they | focus | on | the | strengthening | of | rural | farming | SDG2 | promote | sustainable | means | of | food | production | that | improve | resource | efficiency | SDG12 | and | nature | and | biodiversity | protection | SDG15 | Therefore | results | from | this | study | should | also | be | useful | in | designing | strategies | to | contribute | to | achieving | these | goals

Primary | valuation | studies | of | farmers | and | foresters | preferences | to | accept | compensation | for | participating | in | AES | have | so | far | mainly | focused | on | results | oriented | schemes | e.g. | Villanueva | et | al | 2015 | Birge | et | al | 2017 | In | these | land | managers | receive | compensation | for | delivering | certain | environmental | services | and | benefits | to | the | public | Burton | and | Schwarz | 2013 | relating | to | early | notions | of | agriculture | multi | functionality | Huang | et | al | 2015 | and | more | recently | to | provision | of | public | goods | and | ecosystem | services | from | agriculture | Schaller | et | al | 2018 | The | studies | focus | on | contractual | aspects | such | as | whether | offering | monitoring | of | results | or | scientific | and | farm | advisor | support | affects | their | willingness | to | participate | in | the | scheme | e.g. | Espinosa | Goded | et | al | 2010 | Hasler | et | al | 2019 | or | whether | length | of | contract | duration | has | any | effect | on | acceptability | of | the | scheme | e.g. | Santos | et | al | 2015 | The | AES | studied | in | this | literature | are | a | mix | of | elements | from | actual | existing | AES | contracts | and | from | hypothetical | schemes | that | researchers | believe | would | be | more | appropriate | or | applicable | to | the | needs | of | land | managers

A | common | feature | in | these | studies | is | the | way | they | conceptualise | the | environmental | features | of | the | AES | in | the | form | of | set | aside | land | for | environmental | purposes | While | the | framing | of | such | set | aside | land | varies | across | studies | i.e. | by | presenting | it | as | afforestation | for | recreation | purposes | or | biodiversity | increase | biodiversity | offsetting | ecologically | focus | areas | EFA | buffer | or | riparian | strips | zones | or | protection | from | grazing | in | all | of | them | land | managers | are | offered | some | contractual | options | to | mitigate | the | loss | of | income | occurred | from | setting | the | land | aside | Some | studies | focus | solely | on | such | set | aside | options | e.g. | Villanueva | et | al | 2015 | Santos | et | al | 2015 | while | others | included | it | amongst | other | features | such | as | environmentally | friendly | land | management | practice | e. | g. | use | of | biological | fertiliser | in | Latacz | Lohmann | and | Breustedt | 2019 | The | loss | of | income | from | set | aside | land | impacts | the | economic | welfare | of | land | managers | and | compensation | needs | to | be | offered | to | incentivise | them | to | enrol | in | such | schemes | This | compensation | is | what | these | studies | measure | using | the | notion | of | WTA | obtained | via | surveys | using | so | called | stated | preferences | techniques | e.g. | Chèze | et | al | 2020 | WTA | in | neoclassical | economics | is | the | monetary | amount | that | an | individual | is | willing | to | receive | as | compensation | for | a | certain | loss | of | welfare | that | would | restore | welfare | to | its | previous | level | Hanemann | 1991 | In | the | context | of | this | paper | this | refers | to | the | loss | of | farm | or | land | rent | income | due | to | taking | land | out | of | production | to | deliver | biodiversity | and | environmental | benefits | as | well | as | transaction | and | implementation | costs | the | land | manager | incurs | as | part | of | that | process | In | other | terms | land | managers | are | awarded | compensation | for | delivering | a | public | good | biodiversity | enhancement | or | the | protection | of | environmental | features | while | initially | incurring | some | loss | of | private | income | for | not | producing | other | privately | sold | goods | such | as | agricultural | product | or | timber | The | underlining | assumption | rooted | in | welfare | economics | theory | is | that | survey | respondents | in | this | case | land | managers | are | going | to | behave | rationally | maximising | their | utility | and | without | displaying | strategic | behaviour | when | stating | their | WTA | del | Saz | Salazar | et | al | 2009 | It | should | be | noted | thought | that | land | managers | welfare | can | be | affected | by | non | monetary | aspects | such | as | social | dimensions | inclusion | exclusion | from | a | group | of | fellow | land | managers | if | you | participate | or | not | in | a | scheme | and | benefiting | from | maintaining | a | certain | environmental | status | of | a | public | good | Kuhfuss | et | al | 2016 | Skuras | and | Tyllianakis | 2018

Focusing | on | surveys | asking | land | managers | for | their | WTA | to | have | land | taken | out | of | production | for | to | support | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | allows | us | to | collect | a | relatively | uniform | measure | of | economic | welfare | in | the | same | format | across | studies | Euros | per | land | manager | per | hectare | of | land | per | year | and | to | look | for | factors | that | may | influence | WTA | The | use | of | welfare | measures | such | as | WTA | has | been | shown | to | qualify | as | effect | sizes | for | meta | analysis | Bateman | and | Jones | 2003

Searches | were | carried | out | in | both | ISI | Web | of | Science | and | Google | Scholar | While | Google | Scholar | has | received | criticism | Boeker | et | al | 2013 | it | was | considered | appropriate | in | this | case | since | it | was | anticipated | that | the | literature | would | be | small | and | hence | the | search | attempted | to | also | gather | grey | literature | However | searches | in | both | databases | produced | the | same | results | A | first | search | using | as | primary | keywords | the | terms | Agri | Environment | Scheme | and | Willingness | to | Accept | produced | 111 | documents | Additional | searches | in | all | search | fields | in | ISI | with | the | two | aforementioned | keywords | and | a | combination | of | each | of | the | following | secondary | terms | farmer(s | OR | land | manager(s | OR | biodiversity | OR | set | aside | OR | ecologically | focus | area | OR | afforestation | were | also | conducted | During | this | search | we | explicitly | excluded | papers | that | referred | to | the | schemes | exclusively | as | payments | for | ecosystem | services | PES | and | did | not | also | explicitly | use | the | terminology | agri | environment | schemes | The | reason | for | doing | so | is | because | the | very | definition | of | PES | is | currently | being | contested | and | it | is | notoriously | fuzzy | Martin | Ortega | et | al | 2013 | Wunder | 2015 | By | doing | so | we | remain | aligned | to | how | the | original | studies | defined | the | schemes | they | were | analysing | This | search | resulted | in | 79 | studies

These | 79 | studies | were | filtered | based | on | whether | they | provided | key | statistical | information | sample | size | and | measures | of | statistical | variability | such | as | standard | errors | or | deviation | or | P | values | and | what | was | considered | as | the | effect | size | mean | WTA | over | the | sample | size | Studies | that | did | not | include | one | of | these | estimates | were | excluded | from | the | analysis | as | not | meeting | sufficient | quality | criteria | e.g. | Lizin | et | al | 2015 | and | this | resulted | in | 27 | studies | being | retained | The | search | was | initially | not | geographically | restricted | However | the | vast | majority | of | studies | identified | were | carried | out | in | Europe | probably | due | to | the | effect | of | AES | being | prominent | in | EU | under | CAP | only | five | studies | reporting | on | Australia | Taiwan | Kenya | and | Uganda | appeared | in | the | list | The | meta | analysis | regression | was | subsequently | undertaken | only | for | the | EU | studies | excluding | non | EU | countries | such | as | Switzerland | and | Norway | given | the | majority | of | the | studies | took | place | there | and | the | contract | design | was | more | similar | across | those | surveys | This | led | to | a | total | final | number | of | 20 | primary | studies | When | studies | reported | several | estimates | over | different | subsamples | these | were | considered | as | separate | WTA | observations | and | reported | accordingly | e.g. | Hasler | et | al | 2019 | This | led | to | a | total | final | number | of | 26 | distinct | WTA | observations | out | of | the | 20 | studies

In | the | literature | both | negative | and | positive | WTA | estimates | exist | for | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | enhancing | contracts | This | requires | some | attention | since | it | has | critical | implications | for | the | regression | of | these | values | Positive | WTA | corresponds | to | the | welfare | measure | as | explained | earlier | i.e. | the | amount | of | money | that | the | land | manager | would | accept | to | maintain | their | welfare | level | in | compensation | for | the | loss | of | income | due | to | lack | of | production | in | the | set | aside | land | Negative | WTA | can | not | however | be | interpreted | instead | as | willing | to | pay | WTP | in | this | particular | context | While | WTP | is | another | measure | of | welfare | change | in | neoclassical | economics | terms | it | is | incongruent | when | referring | to | farmer | 's | enrolment | in | AES | as | it | would | mean | that | land | managers | are | actually | willing | to | pay | to | incur | a | cost | or | forego | some | income | to | set | aside | land | from | production | or | to | put | in | economic | terms | confound | consumer | surplus | and | equivalent | surplus | Hanley | et | al | 2009 | This | would | mean | that | implementing | the | contract | has | no | net | costs | to | the | land | managers | i. | e. | there | are | no | trade | offs | Therefore | negative | WTA | should | be | interpreted | instead | as | an | indication | that | the | suggested | options | to | respondents | in | the | stated | preference | survey | were | not | appealing | enough | or | that | respondents | interests | were | fundamentally | against | engaging | in | the | delivery | of | biodiversity | enhancing | and | protecting | environmental | features | what | in | environmental | economics | is | referred | to | as | a | protest | response | Hanley | et | al | 2009 | This | can | be | partially | explained | by | the | range | of | compensation | land | managers | are | offered | in | primary | valuation | studies | with | small | ranges | increasing | non | participation | or | protest | responses | Villanueva | et | al | 2017 | For | the | purpose | of | the | present | systematic | review | we | keep | both | type | of | studies | i.e. | the | ones | reporting | positive | WTA | as | well | as | negative | WTA | but | we | distinguish | between | them | in | the | analysis | This | leads | to | two | regression | models | one | with | the | full | set | of | WTA | estimates | N | 26 | and | one | only | for | the | positive | and | statistically | significant | WTA | estimates | N | 13 | labelled | best | set | of | studies | We | then | discuss | the | implications | of | the | differences | amongst | these | two | models

Income | is | expected | to | negatively | impact | WTA | as | dictated | by | the | theory | of | diminishing | marginal | utility | Groothuis | et | al | 1998 | Information | on | income | is | traditionally | expected | to | be | collected | in | stated | preference | surveys | but | past | meta | analyses | have | shown | it | is | not | always | the | case | e.g. | Tyllianakis | and | Skuras | 2016 | To | have | a | uniform | income | measure | and | overcome | potential | missing | information | from | studies | on | farmers | income | we | use | income | data | for | the | European | level | provided | in | the | European | Commission | 's | database | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | FADN | EU | Open | Portal | Data | EU | 2021 | As | the | latest | FADN | data | available | end | in | 2017 | the | income | estimates | for | studies | carried | out | in | 2018 | and | 2019 | were | adjusted | for | inflation | on | 2019 | prices | 1 |  | The | extent | of | land | under | production | that | a | manager | has | is | expected | to | influence | WTA | as | such | land | is | the | only | one | that | can | be | enroled | in | AES | European | Commission | 2020a | 2020b | As | with | income | only | few | primary | studies | were | found | to | collect | such | information | e.g. | McGurk | et | al | 2020 | As | an | approximation | of | land | size | farm | size | in | the | FADN | data | on | Utilised | Agricultural | Land | UAA | at | the | country | level | were | used | UAA | estimates | were | assumed | to | be | identical | with | 2017 | estimates | for | studies | conducted | after | that | date | Finally | as | the | distribution | of | studies | was | geographically | diverse | and | AES | have | been | found | to | be | influenced | by | climate | in | Europe | Eurostat | 2017 | the | climate | where | the | study | was | carried | out | was | also | recorded | by | classifying | countries | under | the | Köppen | Geiger | classification | system | Kottek | et | al | 2006

The | full | literature | search | and | information | extrapolation | process | can | be | seen | in | Fig | 1 | and | the | full | list | of | studies | is | found | in | Appendix | 1

The | analysis | of | the | evidence | occurs | it | two | phases | first | we | provide | an | overview | of | the | evidence | based | on | simple | descriptive | statistics | This | includes | evidence | across | the | following | categories | see | also | Fig | 1 | i. | Study | variables | referring | to | year | of | study | sample | size | type | of | stated | preference | method | and | type | of | land | managers | targeted | ii | Scheme | variables | referring | to | whether | schemes | were | described | explicitly | as | AES | to | survey | respondents | and | whether | the | schemes | targeted | explicitly | biodiversity | or | whether | they | targeted | environmental | features | more | generally | iii | Contract | characteristics | variables | referring | to | the | contract | options | offered | to | land | managers | having | lengthier | contracts | or | the | requirement | of | monitoring | of | results | iv | Statistical | design | variables | referring | to | statistical | information | regarding | WTA | such | us | positive | or | negative | WTA | v. | Sociodemographic | variables | e.g. | farm | size | age | and | income | vi | Climatic | variables | referring | to | the | climate | of | the | area | where | a | study | took | place

Secondly | we | developed | a | meta | analytical | model | using | mean | WTA | to | participate | in | the | AES | as | the | dependent | variable | Using | stated | preferences | measures | such | as | WTA | in | a | meta | analysis | is | common | in | the | environmental | economic | literature | Tyllianakis | and | Skuras | 2016 | Penn | and | Hu | 2021 | Mean | WTA | of | farmers | to | participate | in | AES | for | protecting | biodiversity | or | enhancing | of | environmental | land | features | within | the | framework | defining | AES | can | be | considered | a | consistent | and | comparable | effect | size | across | studies | as | it | requires | a | certain | portion | of | land | to | be | set | aside | for | such | purposes | across | all | studies | As | studies | are | collected | from | various | countries | from | studies | offering | different | contract | options | to | farmers | as | well | as | the | fact | that | we | include | both | farming | and | agroforestry | focused | studies | heterogeneity | between | studies | is | expected | Therefore | the | heterogeneity | of | WTA | across | studies | i | can | be | expressed | through | θ | the | grand | population | mean | the | distance | from | the | grand | mean | u | i | and | the | sampling | error | component | ε | i

with | u | i | N(0 | τ | 2 | and | ε | i | N(0 | σ | 2 | i | while | τ | 2 | denotes | the | true | variation | between | studies | In | order | to | further | examine | the | drivers | of | heterogeneity | between | studies | the | use | of | meta | regression | is | advised | Tyllianakis | and | Skuras | 2016 | We | also | account | for | possible | heterogeneity | from | having | multiple | WTA | estimates | from | single | studies | As | such | WTA | follows | a | normal | distribution | around | a | linear | predictor | WTA|θ | i | N

where | θ | i | N(x | i | β | τ | 2 | and | Eq | 1 | becomes

with | u | i | N(0 | τ | 2 | and | ε | i | N(0 | σ | 2 | i | and | x | is | a | vector | of | covariates | that | can | explain | WTA

By | depicting | income | and | WTA | in | a | logarithmic | form | as | part | of | the | socio | economic | characteristics | in | Eq | 2 | we | are | able | to | estimate | also | income | 's | elasticity | for | the | WTA | for | biodiversity | and | environmental | areas | features | i.e. | how | much | does | WTA | increases | or | decreases | by | a | 1 | decrease | or | increase | of | the | farmer | 's | income | Villanueva | et | al | 2015 | This | serves | as | an | indication | of | how | sensitive | WTA | is | to | land | manager | 's | income | If | the | elasticity | of | WTA | is | greater | than | 1 | then | more | wealthy | land | managers | would | require | higher | compensation | than | less | wealthy | farmers | to | participate | in | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | protecting | AES | having | interesting | implications | in | terms | of | policy | effects

The | descriptive | statistics | from | the | observations | from | the | studies | can | be | found | in | Table | 1 | following | the | structure | presented | in | Fig | 1

Results | show | that | WTA | studies | on | AES | in | Europe | cover | a | period | from | 2007 | to | 2019 | which | also | coincides | with | the | introduction | and | evolution | of | AES | in | the | farming | and | forestry | fields | as | it | has | been | established | by | the | previous | two | CAP | periods | European | Parliament | 2020

Twenty | three | studies | surveyed | farmers | including | sheep | and | beef | farmers | and | crop | farmers | whereas | only | three | studies | surveyed | forest | owners | Only | five | studies | referred | to | the | AES | also | in | terms | of | PES | and | the | majority | 21 | studies | referred | explicitly | to | AES | only | and | did | not | confound | them | with | other | types | of | framings | With | regards | to | the | methods | used | to | measure | WTA | 25 | studies | used | the | choice | experiment | CE | method | and | only | one | study | used | the | contingent | valuation | CV | method | see | Adamowicz | et | al | 1998 | for | a | description | of | the | differences | between | the | two

Forty | four | percent | of | the | studies | had | biodiversity | increase | or | protection | as | an | explicit | goal | of | the | AES | while | considerably | more | 77 | had | AES | focusing | on | some | type | of | protection | or | enhancement | of | environmental | features | i.e. | not | explicitly | focusing | on | biodiversity | In | more | than | half | of | the | studies | 65 | WTA | estimates | focused | explicitly | on | some | type | of | set | aside | land | either | generically | e.g. | Villamayor | Tomas | et | al | 2019 | or | as | Ecological | Focus | Areas | e.g. | Villanueva | et | al | 2015 | The | rest | of | the | studies | included | set | aside | as | a | by | product | of | environmentally | friendly | ways | of | land | management | through | e.g. | adopting | nitrogen | fixing | crops | e.g. | Espinosa | Goded | et | al | 2010 | vulnerable | ecosystem | protection | e.g. | Czajkowski | et | al | 2019 | and | afforestation | e.g. | Tyrväinen | et | al | 2020 | The | majority | of | studies | 69 | presented | contracts | to | land | managers | that | also | included | more | features | apart | from | the | set | aside | land | such | as | fertiliser | use | and | flexibility | over | the | area | enroled | in | the | scheme | e.g. | Beharry | Borg | et | al | 2013 | Espinosa | Goded | et | al | 2010

Thirteen | studies | in | our | review | reported | negative | WTA | which | as | previously | explained | is | to | be | interpreted | as | either | an | indication | that | the | offer | presented | in | the | valuation | survey | was | not | appealing | enough | to | the | respondents | or | as | representing | a | form | of | protest | against | the | valuation | exercise | Either | case | calls | for | caution | in | the | interpretation | of | the | results | derived | from | these | studies | for | informing | policy | design | as | it | will | be | discussed | Overall | thirteen | studies | 50 | of | studies | reported | positive | 1 | It | could | be | argued | that | income | needs | to | be | corrected | by | purchasing | power | across | the | different | countries | in | the | database | however | this | was | not | feasible | as | the | FADN | database | does | not | provide | estimates | in | such | terms | Past | studies | e.g. | Tyllianakis | and | Skuras | 2016 | that | have | used | several | income | estimates | as | explanatory | variables | in | meta | regressions | have | not | found | differences | between | using | different | income | measures | as | determinants | of | the | effect | size | i.e. | WTA | in | our | case | The | only | significant | differences | in | results | in | such | analyses | was | when | using | the | stated | income | from | participants | in | primary | surveys | compared | to | income | estimates | from | public | or | European | databases | As | the | primary | studies | in | our | meta | analysis | did | not | report | income | from | the | studies | only | 3 | of | them | did | we | did | not | use | such | an | indicator | as | regressors | mean | WTA | while | WTA | being | statistically | significant | which | were | then | used | here | as | a | best | set | of | variables | in | the | regression

The | studies | also | focused | on | a | variety | of | contract | options | and | three | types | of | options | were | of | particular | interest | monitoring | contract | length | and | scientific | support | Monitoring | refers | to | contracts | were | monitoring | of | results | was | a | contract | option | for | land | managers | e.g. | Espinosa | Goded | et | al | 2010 | and | six | studies | 23 | of | the | surveys | offered | that | Contract | length | refers | to | whether | the | schemes | offered | contracts | to | land | managers | that | would | be | longer | than | 5 | years | and | thirteen | studies | offered | that | As | with | monitoring | the | 5 | year | period | is | common | contract | option | is | such | surveys | e.g. | Christensen | et | al | 2011 | Lengthier | contracts | might | increase | land | managers | participation | as | they | offer | a | more | secure | financial | future | for | the | farmers | while | giving | enough | time | for | biodiversity | related | benefits | and | enhancement | of | environmental | feature | to | occur | Such | benefits | are | well | known | to | require | long | periods | of | time | to | occur | e.g. | Vaissière | et | al | 2018 | Finally | scientific | support | refers | to | whether | contracts | offered | to | land | managers | included | any | type | of | scientific | and | farm | advisory | support | and | 8 | studies | in | our | sample | offered | such | a | contract | feature | Such | support | might | make | land | managers | more | inclined | to | enrol | as | contract | requirements | might | feel | more | feasible | Emery | and | Franks | 2012

More | than | half | 58 | of | the | studies | did | not | report | farmers | farm | sizes | while | only | 11 | reported | some | measure | of | farm | income | Serious | lack | of | reporting | in | the | literature | was | observed | with | respect | to | sociodemographic | variables | Only | 35 | of | the | studies | reported | the | mean | age | of | their | sample

Eight | studies | took | place | in | Mediterranean | climates | under | the | Köppen | Geiger | classification | system | Spain | south | of | France | and | Portugal | five | studies | were | undertaken | in | areas | with | warm | summers | and | wet | winters | France | apart | from | the | south | and | UK | while | three | studies | were | conducted | in | cold | climates | Sweden | and | Finland | The | rest | of | studies | 23 | were | conducted | in | continental | climates | including | Germany | Denmark | and | the | UK | among | others

Table | 2 | shows | the | differences | in | average | WTA | value | changes | when | weighting | of | studies | according | to | the | inverse | variance | method | is | applied | Initially | we | estimate | a | fixed | effects | model | using | Eq | 1 | for | the | pooled | set | of | studies | Then | a | random | effects | model | following | DerSimonian | and | Laird | 1986 | was | fitted | to | the | same | data | estimated | in | R | R | Core | Team | 2013 | with | the | meta | command | from | Schwarzer | 2007 | on | the | mean | WTA | values | of | all | 26 | studies | The | fixed | effects | FE | and | random | effects | RE | meta | analysis | results | show | large | differences | In | both | cases | the | mean | WTA | is | negative | but | in | the | FE | it | is | much | smaller | 13.94 | Euros | ha | year | in | the | FE | vs. | 0.86 | Euros | ha | year | in | the | RE | This | difference | is | statistically | significant | at | the | 1 | level | demonstrating | between | study | heterogeneity | The | high | I | 2 | 100 | shows | the | large | variation | between | studies | might | be | due | to | real | variations | in | WTA | also | justifying | the | use | of | a | random | effects | meta | analysis | In | order | to | explain | the | variation | between | studies | we | conducted | a | series | of | subgroup | analyses | and | tested | whether | their | differences | were | statistically | significant | First | we | tested | whether | WTA | was | different | between | studies | explicitly | using | the | AES | framing | and | those | that | referred | to | AES | and | PES | framing | interchangeably | The | results | were | statistically | insignificant | Then | we | tested | for | differences | between | studies | that | explicitly | used | the | CAP | as | their | reference | for | designing | the | proposed | AES | and | those | which | did | not | explicit | use | the | CAP | framing | No | statistical | significant | differences | were | found | between | these | studies | either | Offering | support | to | farmers | as | part | of | their | contract | was | significantly | different | between | groups | with | the | studies | that | offered | it | having | a | WTA | of | 215.84 | Euros | CI:− | 360 | 71.30 | compared | to | those | that | did | not | WTA=178 | Euros | ha | year | CI:137.1 | 220.8 | Studies | offering | contracts | longer | than | 5 | years | WTA | 217.19 | Euros | ha | year | CI:350.46 | also | were | statistically | different | from | those | that | did | not | WTA=221.61 | Euros | ha | year | CI | 177.01 | 266.22 | WTA | of | studies | with | schemes | offering | land | managers | monitoring | of | results | also | were | statistically | different | from | those | that | did | not | The | forest | plot | of | all | studies | by | year | of | survey | implementation | is | presented | in | Fig | 2 | in | the | Appendix

We | also | examined | how | estimates | change | based | when | reducing | them | to | the | best | set | of | studies | as | defined | earlier | i.e. | when | restricting | it | to | studies | which | have | a | positive | and | statistically | significant | mean | WTA | in | a | RE | model | The | result | is | a | positive | mean | WTA | of | 327.02 | Euros | ha | year | for | delivering | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | It | is | worth | noticing | the | dramatic | effect | that | including | negative | WTA | values | has | on | the | average | regressed | value | which | moves | from | 0.86 | 327.02 | Euros/ | ha | year | in | the | RE | models | see | Table | 2

The | forest | plot | for | this | best | set | of | studies | by | year | of | study | is | presented | in | Fig | 3 | This | shows | how | earlier | studies | were | closer | to | the | mean | estimate | than | most | of | the | later | studies

In | order | to | understand | the | factors | determining | heterogeneity | on | WTA | across | studies | meta | regressions | were | run | in | Stata15 | using | the | xtreg | command | in | order | to | include | clustered | standard | errors | and | account | for | inter | dependencies | of | data | from | multiple | studies | as | advised | in | Harbord | and | Higgins | 2008 | The | metareg | command | that | assumes | a | cross | sectional | data | layout | and | normal | standard | errors | was | also | used | For | that | the | evidence | collected | from | the | studies | and | that | has | been | presented | in | tabulated | form | in | Table | 1 | was | tested | in | a | regression | as | independent | variables | These | were | defined | by | the | variables | which | during | the | subgroup | analysis | in | Section | 3.2 | showed | statistically | significant | differences | in | mean | WTA | We | also | included | variables | for | key | sociodemographic | characteristics | as | is | common | in | the | literature | as | well | as | one | related | to | the | geo | climatic | context | of | the | country | where | the | study | took | place | Each | of | the | six | categories | of | data | detailed | in | Section | 2.2 | was | represented | in | the | models | The | FADN | measure | of | gross | farm | income | was | selected | from | the | list | of | socio | economic | variables | while | the | variable | indicating | whether | the | study | took | place | in | a | cold | climate | country | according | to | the | Köppen | Geiger | classification | was | selected | for | the | geographic | variables | The | meta | regressions | were | run | for | the | pooled | positive | and | negative | WTA | observations | and | for | the | best | set | of | studies | with | cross | section | and | panel | data | layout | models | Table | 3 | as | is | common | in | other | meta | analyses | of | welfare | measures | within | the | field | Tyllianakis | and | Skuras | 2016 | Jacobsen | and | Hanley | 2009

As | expected | model | fit | is | better | for | the | best | set | than | the | pooled | models | The | random | effects | models | also | show | a | better | fit | with | the | bestset | random | effects | model | displaying | a | fairly | good | fit | 68 | compared | to | the | literature | in | this | field | e.g. | Soon | and | Ahmad | 2015 | Tyllianakis | and | Skuras | 2016 | This | confirms | that | WTA | estimates | from | multiple | studies | indeed | impact | the | results | and | that | including | the | negative | WTA | estimates | very | much | affects | the | results | It | should | be | noted | though | that | the | difference | between | the | estimates | of | the | best | set | model | that | accounts | for | within | study | heterogeneity | with | clustered | standard | errors | and | the | model | that | does | not | is | very | small | showing | that | the | best | fit | model | for | the | best | set | does | not | suffer | from | non | independencies | in | the | data

In | terms | of | the | factors | that | affect | WTA | there | is | great | variability | across | the | four | models | The | contract | length | variable | is | significant | in | the | two | pooled | models | The | sign | is | negative | which | would | have | indicated | that | longer | contracts | lower | the | compensation | that | farmers | require | to | enter | the | schemes | However | this | variable | is | not | significant | in | the | bestset | models | Support | offered | is | not | significant | in | the | pooled | models | but | it | is | in | the | two | best | set | models | The | sign | is | negative | indicating | that | farmers | would | be | willing | to | accept | less | compensation | to | enrol | if | they | obtain | support | Monitoring | is | significant | and | positive | in | the | random | effects | best | set | model | The | positive | sign | indicates | that | if | there | is | monitoring | farmers | would | require | higher | compensation | Effects | of | whether | the | schemes | focus | specifically | on | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | are | quite | inconsistent | across | the | four | models | with | diverging | signs | and | statistical | significance | and | in | any | case | non | significant | in | the | best | set | random | effects | model | The | effect | of | the | geo | climatic | region | is | also | inconsistent | across | all | models | and | in | any | case | not | significant | in | the | best | set | random | effects | model | Gross | farm | income | is | significant | across | all | models | except | for | the | pooled | cross | section | one | but | very | small | estimate | 0.01

As | income | is | showed | to | be | significantly | impacting | WTA | for | enroling | in | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | protecting | AES | across | models | in | Table | 3 | a | simple | model | with | both | sides | of | Eq | 2 | logarithmically | transformed | was | estimated | to | measure | the | sensitivity | of | WTA | with | changes | in | income | Apart | from | the | measure | of | gross | farm | income | the | net | farm | income | for | the | countries | where | the | primary | studies | took | place | as | provided | by | FADN | was | used | to | check | for | consistency | Naturally | such | a | model | includes | only | studies | with | positive | WTA | given | WTA | values | are | log | transformed | The | results | are | presented | in | Table | 4 | and | show | that | elasticity | 's | absolute | value | is | higher | than | one | and | significant | for | the | net | farm | income | measure | Significant | elasticity | higher | than | one | means | that | the | proportion | of | WTA | to | the | income | measure | increases | as | income | increases | i.e. | wealthier | farmers | benefit | more | from | enroling | in | AES

The | literature | regarding | land | managers | WTA | compensation | to | enrol | in | AES | targeting | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | in | Europe | is | relatively | recent | and | limited | but | growing | Studies | included | in | this | work | span | over | two | different | CAP | periods | where | a | move | towards | compulsory | measures | of | greening | and | set | aside | areas | is | evident | and | reflected | in | the | academic | effort | with | over | 70 | of | the | studies | having | taken | place | in | the | last | ten | years

Studies | focusing | on | environmental | features | are | more | prominent | in | the | AES | literature | than | explicit | biodiversity | protection | This | is | also | aligned | with | what | found | on | studies | in | non | EU | contexts | such | as | agrienvironment | programmes | focusing | on | biodiversity | in | Australia | e.g. | Salt | 2016 | Ansell | et | al | 2016a | Ansell | et | al | 2016b | and | land | conservation | programmes | the | US | Hellerstein | 2017 | In | the | EU | context | this | can | be | attributed | to | the | fact | that | several | of | the | studies | focused | on | Ecological | Focus | Areas | which | have | become | mandatory | under | the | current | CAP | for | arable | farmers | with | land | over | fifteen | hectares | Zinngrebe | et | al | 2017 | while | biodiversity | benefits | are | less | clearly | spelled | out | as | they | are | assumed | to | be | co | benefits | from | ecologically | focus | areas | European | Commission | 2017 | Of | the | various | scheme | characteristics | that | might | increase | likelihood | of | land | manager | participation | i.e. | monitoring | offering | scientific | support | and | lengthier | contracts | none | appeared | in | the | majority | of | the | studies | in | the | literature | at | most | in | 48 | in | the | case | of | having | contracts | longer | than | 5 | years | Such | a | finding | is | a | clear | testimony | of | the | variety | of | AES | contracts | offered | in | Europe | under | CAP | in | its | evolving | formulation | as | well | as | a | lack | of | consistency | in | the | support | provided | to | land | managers | in | the | delivery | benefits | related | to | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | Proctor | et | al | 2012

From | the | general | overview | of | the | evidence | two | findings | are | most | striking | On | the | one | hand | is | the | really | scarce | reporting | on | key | characteristics | such | as | farm | size | and | more | importantly | farm | income | in | the | studies | While | understandable | since | it | is | always | hard | to | get | land | managers | to | report | their | income | this | on | itself | is | problematic | since | it | restricts | significantly | the | policy | messages | that | can | be | derived | from | the | evidence | across | the | board

On | the | other | hand | is | the | fact | that | 48 | of | the | existing | studies | report | negative | WTA | for | enroling | in | such | AES | As | mentioned | negative | WTA | is | to | be | considered | in | this | context | as | land | managers | not | willing | to | trade | off | land | productivity | for | monetary | compensation | for | the | delivery | of | biodiversity | environmental | features | or | that | they | protest | to | such | trade | offs | as | presented | in | the | existing | studies | Czajkowski | et | al | 2019 | The | emphasis | on | as | presented | in | the | existing | studies | is | an | important | one | here | that | relates | to | a | complex | picture | requiring | careful | discussion | At | a | first | glance | this | would | suggest | a | widespread | reluctance | from | the | part | of | land | managers | to | accepting | the | terms | of | compensation | either | because | they | do | not | have | an | interest | in | delivering | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | protection | or | because | they | are | not | willing | to | incur | into | the | Fig | 2 | Mean | effect | from | random | effects | meta | analysis | of | AES | focusing | on | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | from | 26 | studies | both | positive | and | negative | WTA

trade | off | as | also | suggested | by | the | negative | mean | WTA | in | Table | 2 | for | the | pooled | model | However | an | in | depth | look | into | the | broader | results | challenges | this | conclusion | or | in | any | case | makes | it | more | nuanced | Firstly | as | the | results | of | the | meta | regression | models | in | Table | 3 | show | the | constant | in | the | pooled | model | is | highly | positive | and | significant

Statistically | a | significant | model | constant | in | this | context | means | that | land | managers | are | in | principle | willing | to | accept | a | change | from | the | status | quo | Borenstein | et | al | 2015 | This | would | therefore | suggest | that | they | are | open | for | compensation | to | enrol | in | AES | schemes | just | possibly | not | in | trade | off | of | the | features | offered | to | them | as | per | the | studies | This | suggest | Fig | 3 | Mean | effect | from | random | effects | meta | analysis | of | Agri | Environment | Schemes | focusing | on | biodiversity | or | environmental | features | from | best | set | of | studies | 13 | studies | with | positive | and | statistically | significant | WTA | that | the | issue | is | not | necessarily | a | general | lack | of | willingness | by | land | managers | to | receive | compensation | for | biodiversity | environmental | features | but | rather | the | effect | of | protest | lack | of | preference | for | the | specific | ways | in | which | these | features | are | delivered | to | them | in | the | studied | AES | schemes | This | also | resonates | with | findings | from | the | quantitative | study | by | Czajkowski | et | al | 2019 | and | qualitative | studies | e.g. | Uthes | and | Matzdorf | 2013 | It | seems | therefore | that | land | managers | would | be | generally | willing | to | trade | off | compensation | for | the | delivery | of | biodiversity | or | ecological | features | but | that | we | academia | and/or | policy | are | not | yet | hitting | the | right | key | on | how | to | best | match | their | preferences | for | it

A | closer | look | at | the | factors | influencing | WTA | Table | 3 | also | deepens | in | this | complex | picture | Firstly | as | noted | there | are | great | levels | of | inconsistency | and | variability | depending | on | the | evidence | that | is | included | in | the | regressions | pooled | vs. | best | set | providing | in | the | overall | a | weak | evidence | base | If | not | scrutinised | carefully | it | can | lead | to | potentially | biased | policy | recommendations | considering | the | large | effects | on | impacts | and | signs | that | the | negative | WTA | estimates | have | in | the | pooled | model | Focusing | primarily | in | the | best | set | random | effects | model | i.e. | the | most | robust | evidence | albeit | reduced | it | would | seem | that | offering | support | to | farmers | as | part | of | their | contract | may | reduce | the | amount | of | compensation | that | they | are | willing | to | accept | for | enroling | This | is | consistent | with | findings | from | qualitative | farmer | surveys | e.g. | Emery | and | Franks | 2012 | where | this | feature | was | explicitly | requested | by | farmers | for | future | AES | However | the | actual | model | estimate | for | this | variable | 1188.10 | makes | the | policy | translation | of | this | result | implausible | This | estimate | would | indicate | that | farmers | are | willing | to | lower | their | compensation | by | over | one | thousand | euros | per | hectare | per | year | for | having | this | feature | in | their | contract | This | is | higher | than | the | highest | compensation | in | EU | funded | AES | when | Natura | 2000 | areas | are | included | in | the | land | under | contract | where | payment | can | rise | up | to | 900 | Euros | hectare | year | -otherwise | highest | levels | are | of | 450 | Euros | European | Network | for | Rural | Development | 2015 | Something | similar | happens | with | the | statistically | significant | estimate | for | the | variable | on | whether | the | scheme | includes | specific | environmental | features | in | the | best | set | non | clustered | model | 901.99 | Having | monitoring | as | contractual | feature | in | the | AES | on | the | other | hand | does | yield | statistically | significant | and | plausible | results | in | the | best | set | random | effects | model | positive | estimate | of | 93.36 | It | makes | sense | to | think | that | farmers | would | be | requiring | higher | compensation | if | they | are | going | to | be | monitored | in | their | compliance | with | the | scheme | e.g. | Vedel | et | al | 2015a | Vedel | et | al | 2015b | as | a | sort | of | compensation | for | being | policed | Re | imagining | ways | of | monitoring | compliance | in | ways | that | farmers | are | less | put | off | by | it | e.g. | using | awareness | focused | participatory | approaches | Okumah | et | al | 2021 | or | offering | payment | based | on | modelled | results | instead | of | surveyed | or | sampled | results | Bartkowski | et | al | 2021 | may | provide | some | interesting | avenues | moving | forward

Significant | negative | effect | of | income | in | WTA | Table | 3 | is | in | line | with | what | has | been | reported | by | some | of | the | general | environmental | literature | e.g. | del | Saz | Salazar | et | al | 2012 | but | the | effect | is | so | small | 1 | that | it | does | not | seem | of | particular | policy | relevance | in | this | context | More | interesting | however | are | the | policy | implications | of | income | 's | elasticity | in | WTA | as | they | reveal | the | effect | that | the | policy | AES | delivering | biodiversity | and | environmental | features | protection | has | on | income | Our | findings | Table | 4 | would | indicate | that | wealthier | farmers | stand | to | gain | more | than | less | wealthy | farmers | from | enroling | in | AES | focusing | on | biodiversity | and | environmental | features | protection | This | is | to | some | extent | miss | aligned | with | environmental | and | policy | goals | for | the | new | CAP | European | Commission | 2013 | and | the | requirements | for | achieving | SDGs | e.g. | SDG2 | Griggs | et | al | 2017 | which | place | a | renewed | emphasis | in | the | promotion | of | rural | development | and | landscape | wide | approaches | for | a | more | effective | delivery | of | biodiversity | and | environmental | protection | If | such | AES | are | to | be | successful | in | achieving | those | goals | then | new | mechanisms | for | encouraging | land | managers | with | smaller | holdings | who | also | tend | to | have | lower | income | to | enrol | are | needed | If | these | schemes | also | promoted | collaboration | of | adjacent | small | land | holdings | via | collective | action | Vanni | 2014 | e.g. | by | providing | incentive | such | as | agglomeration | bonuses | Sheremet | et | al | 2018 | then | more | effective | delivery | of | environmental | protection | is | likely | to | be | achieved | replicating | what | happens | in | larger | holdings | e.g. | Dallimer | et | al | 2010 | Schou | et | al | 2020 | A | final | note | on | the | average | WTA | values | The | analysis | of | the | best | set | of | studies | shows | an | average | of | 327 | Euros | hectare | year | Table | 2 | which | is | close | to | the | average | EU | Direct | Payments | under | Pillar | I | i.e. | around | 350 | Euros | per | hectare | European | Commission | 2018a | 2018b | AES | payments | covered | by | this | review | are | Rural | Development | payments | under | Pillar | II | i.e. | subsidies | for | cost | incurred | and | income | foregone | The | relative | high | average | WTA | that | we | find | would | suggest | that | to | deliver | environmental | and | biodiversity | protection | farmers | require | payment | levels | closer | to | current | Direct | Payments | This | finding | also | confirms | the | validity | of | the | use | of | stated | preference | methods | in | the | context | of | preferences | of | suppliers | such | as | farmers | and | foresters | of | ecosystem | services | similar | to | Rodríguez | Entrena | et | al | 2019

Of | course | receiving | compensation | to | participate | in | any | AES | is | a | key | but | not | the | only | driver | for | participation | since | there | is | some | evidence | for | voluntary | farmer | participation | in | environmental | activities | For | example | Mills | et | al | 2018 | show | that | farmers | have | been | found | to | still | undertake | environmental | activities | in | unsubsidised | land | although | it | should | be | noted | that | this | land | was | adjacent | to | subsidised | land | and | likely | to | have | been | benefited | from | this | proximity | Having | said | that | Rodríguez | Entrena | et | al | 2019 | have | shown | how | payments | are | usually | the | contract | feature | that | farmers | focus | most | on

Compensating | land | managers | for | the | provision | of | public | goods | is | currently | one | of | the | European | Union | 's | flagship | policies | and | one | that | that | resonates | across | the | globe | more | generally | in | the | effort | to | meet | Sustainable | Development | Goals | Despite | having | been | central | to | the | EU | 's | Common | Agricultural | Policy | for | several | decades | now | Agri | Environment | Schemes | AES | seem | to | only | have | had | limited | success | in | preserving | biodiversity | and | providing | environmental | benefits | In | part | the | reasons | for | such | limited | success | are | attributed | to | factors | that | make | farmers | more | or | less | inclined | to | adopt | the | schemes | and | accept | compensation | for | the | delivery | of | these | biodiversity | environmental | features | This | paper | has | systematically | reviewed | and | quantified | for | the | first | time | the | body | of | evidence | that | explores | these | factors | with | respect | to | their | influence | on | land | managers | welfare | through | the | neoclassical | economics | notion | of | willingness | to | accept | WTA | compensation

A | first | conclusion | is | that | the | evidence | base | is | still | relatively | scarce | but | growing | in | accordance | to | the | increased | focus | of | the | European | Union | in | biodiversity | and | environmental | provision | While | this | relative | scarcity | is | understandable | the | fact | the | published | evidence | fails | to | report | key | aspects | such | effects | of | farm | size | and | farm | income | is | problematic | since | it | hampers | the | possibility | of | drawing | broader | conclusions | The | most | striking | result | of | our | review | however | resides | on | the | amount | of | studies | reporting | negative | WTA | values | and | the | complex | and | nuanced | picture | that | the | broader | results | draw | with | respect | to | this | matter | These | broader | results | lead | us | to | conclude | that | farmers | are | generally | inclined | to | accept | compensation | for | the | delivery | of | biodiversity | environmental | protection | However | the | current | evidence | base | provides | few | clues | on | how | best | that | willingness | is | matched | by | contract | design | formats | and | contract | features | Providing | support | to | farmers | and | exploring | new | ways | of | monitoring | compliance | emerge | as | issues | generally | worth | considering | as | means | of | incentivising | farmers | to | enrol | in | AES | Further | the | broader | evidence | base | seems | to | support | the | idea | that | landscape | solutions | are | going | to | require | new | mechanisms | to | incentivise | smaller | holdings | and | collective | action | of | adjacent | ones | However | this | alone | seems | in | the | overall | like | a | quite | modest | contribution | from | the | body | of | evidence | to | inform | policy | design | more | broadly | It | indeed | seems | that | we | academia | and/or | policy | are | not | yet | hitting | the | right | key | on | how | to | best | match | farmers | preferences | for | enroling | in | AES | for | the | delivery | of | biodiversity | environmental | features | A | significant | leap | forward | would | not | simply | require | an | increased | quantity | of | primary | studies | but | a | deeper | reflexion | on | how | the | complexity | of | farmers | preferences | is | best | captured | in | the | design | of | policy | instruments | that | have | to | both | share | common | features | while | being | adaptable | to | context | dependent | characteristics | at | the | landscape | level | This | is | more | pressing | than | ever | face | to | the | unprecedented | challenges | of | Brexit | and | the | COVID19 | induced | economic | recession | which | is | going | to | put | every | cent | of | public | funding | under | the | hardest | of | scrutinies | in | the | years | to | come
