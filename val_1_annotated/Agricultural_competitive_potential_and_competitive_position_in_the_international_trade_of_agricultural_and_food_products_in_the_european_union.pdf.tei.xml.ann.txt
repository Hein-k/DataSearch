Purpose | This | paper | aimed | to | evaluate | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | in | the | member | states | of | the | European | Union | and | identify | differences | between | them | with | reference | to | the | position | of | such | countries | in | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | Design | Methodology | Approach | The | competitive | potential | was | evaluated | using | a | synthetic | measure | designed | using | TOPSIS | Technique | for | Order | Preference | by | Similarity | to | an | Ideal | Solution | The | potential | was | confronted | with | the | competitive | position | of | the | member | states | of | the | European | Union | in | the | international | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | products | To | this | end | among | other | indicators | the | Revealed | Comparative | Advantage | RCA | index | was | used | The | analysis | was | based | on | data | from | EUROSTAT | and | FADN | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network |  | for | years | 2007 | -2017 |  | Findings |  | Findings |  | The | results | point | to | a | strong | diversification | of | the | level | of | agricultural | development | among | the | member | states | of | the | European | Union | Four | groups | of | countries | characterised | by | a | similar | level | of | the | analysed | phenomenon | were | identified | The | highest | value | of | the | synthetic | measure | was | characteristic | of | the | Netherlands | It | was | more | than | 3 | times | higher | than | in | the | country | least | competitive | in | that | respect | Slovenia | Countries | with | the | highest | agricultural | competitive | potential | such | as | the | Netherlands | Belgium | Denmark | and | France | also | maintain | a | high | competitive | advantage | in | the | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | Many | countries | in | particular | those | included | in

Competitiveness | is | an | underlying | notion | in | economic | sciences | However | this | notion | has | no | clear | universal | definition | which | is | a | result | of | the | fact | that | it | derives | from | at | least | three | trends | in | the | theory | of | economics | the | theory | of | international | trade | theory | of | economic | growth | and | microeconomics | Strojny | 2010 | Latruffe | 2010 | defines | it | as | the | ability | to | face | the | competition | and | to | succeed | against | such | competition | Most | definitions | of | competitiveness | refer | to | the | ability | to | sell | products | with | a | profit | margin | permanently | ensure | a | high | rate | of | return | on | the | production | factors | and | a | high | level | of | employment | which | in | turn | provides | grounds | for | increasing | the | income | of | the | population | achieve | improving | life | standard | and | as | a | result | ensuring | social | welfare

The | European | Commission | 2017 | in | the | report | Measuring | Competitiveness | emphasizes | that | competitiveness | is | strongly | connected | with | productivity | and | trade | A | high | significance | of | productivity | in | competitiveness | analysis | is | indicated | by | Porter | who | identified | sector | competitiveness | next | to | the | competitive | advantage | of | countries | and | nations | He | notes | that | the | only | possible | concept | of | international | competitiveness | of | a | country | is | the | development | of | national | productivity | Porter | 1998 | In | this | paper | the | authors | deem | the | analysis | of | productivity | of | factors | shaping | the | agricultural | competitive | potential | particularly | important | The | origins | of | the | international | theory | of | competitiveness | should | be | sought | in | theories | of | foreign | trade | Olczyk | 2016 | Zawalińska | 2004 | According | to | the | definition | by | the | Commission | of | European | Communities | of | 1983 | international | competitiveness | is | a | capacity | to | catch | up | with | international | competitors | This | definition | evolved | in | the | documents | of | the | European | Communities | and | in | 1985 | according | to | the | Commission | of | EC | international | competitiveness | of | countries | is | their | ability | to | maintain | equilibrium | between | import | and | domestic | production | on | the | domestic | market | in | accordance | with | the | effects | obtained | in | export

In | 1994 | the | Commission | of | EC | saw | the | significance | of | harmonisation | of | economic | growth | with | balanced | foreign | turnover | and | one | year | later | analysing | international | competitiveness | noted | the | capacity | of | improving | or | maintaining | the | life | standard | in | comparison | with | economies | of | other | countries | with | a | similar | level | of | development | without | disturbing | the | external | equilibrium | in | the | long | run | based | on | Misala | 2011 | Definitions | of | international | competitiveness | used | most | frequently | nowadays | refer | mostly | to | the | performance | of | the | specific | country | group | in | international | exchange | and | in | particular | in | the | capacity | of | domestic | businesses | to | operate | in | foreign | markets | the | capability | of | developing | effective | export | increasing | their | share | in | export | market | and | at | the | same | time | increase | the | real | domestic | product | ability | to | maintain | growing | productivity | in | the | long | run | utilize | all | production | factors | high | rate | of | return | of | expenditure | increase | in | employment | and | permanent | improvement | of | living | standard | Misala | 2011 | Pawlak | 2012 | Wosiek | 2016 | Kowalski | Weresa | 2019

Many | authors | including | Gorynia | and | Łaźniewska | 2009 | Misala | 2011 | Bossak | 2013 | and | Bieńkowski | 1995 | emphasize | that | an | important | aspect | of | international | competitiveness | is | differentiating | between | international | competitive | capacity | potential | and | the | competitive | position | of | the | economy | The | competitive | potential | of | the | economy | competitive | capacity | is | the | capacity | of | long | term | growth | in | the | conditions | of | an | open | economy | resulting | in | the | development | of | an | economic | structure | and | an | export | structureconstituting | its | extension | and | reflectionthat | correspond | with | changes | in | the | global | demand | structure | Such | a | definition | of | competitiveness | takes | into | account | the | analysis | of | factors | such | as | the | size | and | structure | of | production | factors | and | the | effectiveness | of | their | utilization | Gorynia | and | Łaźniewska | 2009

In | comparison | with | international | competitive | capacity | and | international | competitiveness | the | notion | of | international | competitive | position | is | much | narrower | It | denotes | the | status | and | changes | in | the | share | of | a | specific | country | in | international | turnover | as | well | as | the | evolution | of | the | structure | of | this | turnover | including | the | respective | transformation | of | quality | This | paper | attempts | to | evaluate | the | competitive | potential | of | agriculture | with | reference | to | the | development | of | the | competitive | position | of | EU | countries | in | the | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | so | the | analysis | covers | both | the | competitive | potential | and | competitive | capacity | taking | into | account | the | regional | research | perspective | in | the | applied | commercial | indicators

In | the | light | of | the | output | of | international | trade | theory | international | competition | is | skilful | utilization | of | natural | comparative | advantages | of | respective | countries | and | the | related | competitive | advantage | According | to | a | review | of | literature | on | international | economics | and | international | trade | the | most | significant | sources | of | comparative | advantages | include | utilization | of | advantage | in | terms | of | equipment | in | underlying | production | factors | and | the | efficiency | of | their | utilization | degree | of | technological | advancement | specialisation | and | export | of | products | that | can | be | produced | at | a | relatively | lower | cost | than | in | other | countries | utilization | of | differentiating | domestic | and | national | preferences | of | economic | entities | achieving | different | types | of | economies | of | scale | in | production | and | sale | Gerber | 2014 | Carbaugh | 2010 | Kerr | and | Gaisford | 2007 | Krugman | 2018 | In | this | paper | the | authors | refer | to | a | larger | extent | to | traditional | theories | of | international | trade | than | to | contemporary | theories | According | to | classical | authors | such | as | A. | Smith | and | D. | Ricardo | Sawyer | and | Sprinkle | 2015 | Koo | andKennedy | 2005 | Ingham | 2004 | the | grounds | for | developing | international | specialization | and | international | trade | are | absolute | Smith | and | relative | Ricardo | differences | in | the | manufacturing | cost | measured | by | labour | inputthis | paper | uses | different | measures | of | labour | productivity | with | reference | to | those | theories | The | resource | abundance | theory | by | Heckscher | and | Ohlin | takes | two | production | factorslabour | and | capital

According | to | the | H | O | theory | the | volume | and | structure | of | international | turnover | derive | from | differences | in | the | real | cost | of | production | following | from | differences | in | extreme | productivity | of | both | factors | Differences | in | productivity | are | due | to | the | relative | abundance | of | factors | in | respective | countries | Świerkocki | 2011 | Helpman | 2011 | Krugman | 2018 | The | classical | theory | of | resource | abundance | is | supplemented | and | elaborated | on | by | two | neo | factor | theories | whose | authors | consider | a | larger | number | of | production | factorse.g | Vanek | Pawlak | 2013 | Vanek | 1963 | Helpman | 2011 | in | his | three | factor | theory | identifies | natural | resources | as | a | production | factor | including | agricultural | land | resources | of | the | country | The | factor | based | approach | is | elaborated | on | by | the | theory | of | competitive | advantage | due | to | having | products | and | production | factors | at | its | disposal | formulated | by | Tesch | 1980 | which | is | connected | with | a | variety | of | production | capabilities | of | absolute | and | permanent | nature | following | from | natural | conditions | such | as | for | example | land | quality | or | climate | and | of | relative | and | interim | nature | related | to | differences | in | the | level | of | technical | knowledge | and | the | qualifications | of | human | resources | and | the | resources | of | capital | Misala | 2011 | The | authors | of | this | paper | refer | to | the | above | mentioned | theories | of | international | trade

The | opening | of | respective | economies | to | the | world | and | the | internationalization | of | economic | relations | increase | the | growing | interest | in | the | evaluation | of | the | international | competitiveness | of | countries | as | well | as | of | groups | of | countries | Strojny | 2010 | International | economic | exchange | has | a | significant | impact | on | the | economy | of | every | country | Johnson | 2013 | Export | is | one | of | the | key | direct | factors | accelerating | economic | growth | Strojny | 2018 | Mercantilists | were | the | first | to | consider | international | trade | and | especially | export | as | an | accelerator | of | the | economic | growth | of | nations | International | competitiveness | of | the | economy | was | understood | in | similar | terms | by | the | creators | of | the | first | theories | of | international | trade | and | in | particular | A. | Smiththe | author | of | the | theory | of | absolute | cost | advantage | and | R. | Torrens | and | D. | Ricardothe | creators | of | the | theory | of | relative | costs | and | comparative | advantage | Ricardo | 's | model | was | tested | multiple | times | and | the | relationship | between | differences | in | the | productivity | of | production | factors | and | trade | flows | was | confirmed | by | studies | carried | out | by | MacDougall | 1951 | Stern | 1962 | Balassa | 1963 | and | Golub | 1995 | mainly | for | industrial | products | and | to | lesser | extent | for | agricultural | products | Therefore | it | is | essential | that | such | studiescovering | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | productsbe | undertaken | for | the | countries | of | the | European | Union | which | is | the | subject | of | this | paper

Agricultural | and | food | products | play | a | special | role | in | international | trade | Increasing | the | export | volume | of | food | and | other | agricultural | products | opens | possibilities | of | developing | the | production | to | domestic | producers | Xiao | and | Reed | 2007 | Numerous | studies | analyse | the | development | of | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | Most | elaborations | focus | on | analysing | the | outcomes | of | competition | using | specific | measures | or | groups | of | measures | but | do | not | analyse | the | competitive | potential | The | analyses | most | often | use | the | competitive | position | measures | such | as | the | Revealed | Comparative | Advantage | Index | RCA | by | Balassa | Balassa | and | Noland | 1989 | Senyshyn | et | al | 2019 | Sarker | and | Shashini | 2014 | Kostoska | and | Hristoski | 2018 | Kousar | et | al | 2019

Most | studies | use | a | whole | set | of | indicators | for | evaluating | the | competitive | position | including | for | example | Export | Market | Share | Index | Trade | Coverage | Index | Relative | Export | and | Import | Indicators | Export | Specialization | Index | Cross | Country | Indices | of | Relative | Competitiveness | Grubel | Loyd | Index | Jarosz | Angowska | 2019 | Maksymets | Lönnstedt | 2016 | Ortikov | et | al | 2019 | Juchniewicz | and | Łukiewska | 2015 | This | study | also | makes | use | of | several | indices | for | the | evaluation | of | the | international | competitive | position | of | EU | countries | including | Export | Market | Share | Index | RCA | Index | Trade | Coverage | Index | and | Grubel | Llyod | Index

Some | researchers | attempt | to | evaluate | the | international | competitiveness | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | in | terms | of | costs | using | the | Domestic | Resource | Cost | measure | to | this | end | Gorton | et | al | 2001 | 2006 | Yercan | and | Isikli | 2006 | The | DRC | compares | the | social | opportunity | costs | of | domestic | production | to | the | value | added | it | generates | in | international | prices | Gorton | 2001 | 2006 | used | the | DRC | index | in | his | assessment | of | the | international | competitiveness | of | agriculture | in | Poland | and | Hungary | before | and | after | accession | to | the | European | Union | The | outcomes | of | studies | generally | point | to | the | loss | of | competitiveness | and | the | necessity | to | modernise | and | increase | productivity | in | order | to | obtain | a | comparative | advantage | and | improve | the | international | competitiveness | in | the | future | This | is | a | consequence | of | a | decrease | in | prices | of | agricultural | products | on | the | global | market | Much | earlier | Fagerberg | 1988 | noted | that | excessive | importance | was | attached | to | the | cost | based | approach | in | the | evaluation | of | international | competitiveness | and | indicated | technological | competitiveness | as | a | significant | factor | Recently | some | authors | Pawlak | 2018 | emphasized | the | significance | of | the | institutional | factor | and | in | particular | the | economic | policy | of | respective | governments | oriented | at | supporting | the | agricultural | sector | indicating | a | greater | importance | of | this | factor | in | developing | international | competitiveness | in | comparison | with | the | availability | of | natural | factors

A | wider | research | context | in | analysing | international | competitiveness | from | the | point | of | view | of | determinants | of | such | competitiveness | was | undertaken | by | authors | such | as | Ball | et | al | 2010 | Viira | et | al | 2015 | and | Yao | 2015 | Ball | et | al | 2010 | designed | a | model | analysing | the | relationship | between | output | defined | as | gross | production | leaving | the | farm | capital | input | land | input | labour | input | and | relative | productivity | levels | and | their | relation | to | international | competitiveness | for | 11 | EU | countries | and | for | the | United | States

Taking | up | studies | in | a | wider | context | of | evaluating | the | effect | of | institutional | factors | policy | market | factors | productivity | and | structure | of | farms | on | international | competitiveness | normally | reduces | the | analysis | to | one | industry | sector | as | in | the | study | by | Viira | et | al | 2015 | who | analysed | competitiveness | of | the | dairy | sector | in | Estonia | In | turn | Yao | 2015 | designed | an | econometric | model | for | evaluating | the | impact | of | factors | such | as | agricultural | modernization | economic | growth | and | industrialization | on | the | international | competitiveness | of | Chinese | agricultural | products

Studies | regarding | agricultural | and | food | trade | in | EU | countries | have | been | undertaken | by | many | authors | However | most | often | they | cover | selected | countries | of | the | European | Union | e.g. | countries | of | Central | and | Eastern | Europe | or | are | based | on | selected | partial | indices | only | Bojnec | and | Ferto | 2012 | Kiss | 2011 | Rytko | 2014 | Drabik | and | Bartova | 2008 | On | the | other | hand | there | are | no | comprehensive | studies | covering | all | member | states | while | at | the | same | time | taking | a | wider | research | context | into | account | A | research | gap | also | exists | as | regards | the | evaluation | of | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | in | EU | countries | Meanwhile | the | production | capabilities | and | at | the | same | time | competitive | capacity | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | are | determined | by | its | competitive | potential | This | is | expressed | as | resources | at | the | disposal | of | respective | countries | Nowak | et | al | 2015 | However | not | only | the | amount | of | resources | creates | the | competitive | potential | It | is | above | all | determined | by | relations | between | them | and | their | efficient | utilization | Exerting | adequate | impact | on | the | production | potential | through | competitiveness | management | leads | to | specific | results | of | competing | -the | competitive | position | Nosecka | et | al | 2011

This | study | mainly | aims | at | a | classification | and | identification | of | homogeneous | groups | of | countries | in | the | European | Union | according | to | selected | factors | shaping | the | agricultural | competitive | potential | and | analysis | of | differences | between | them | with | reference | to | the | position | of | these | countries | in | the | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | A | special | contribution | is | the | analysis | of | multiple | factors | affecting | the | competitiveness | of | agriculture | and | an | attempt | at | ordering | EU | countries | by | means | of | a | synthetic | measure | designed | using | TOPSIS | while | most | papers | investigate | the | effect | of | one | factor | with | a | limited | number | of | competitiveness | measures | One | of | the | purposes | of | this | study | is | the | analysis | of | relationships | between | the | competitive | capacity | and | the | international | competitive | position | of | the | countries | of | the | European | Union | in | the | area | of | agricultural | and | food | products | The | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | of | the | specific | country | determined | by | many | different | factors | affects | the | development | of | its | international | competitiveness | which | theoretically | should | be | reflected | by | the | indicators | of | the | international | competitive | position | of | the | specific | country | This | paper | attempts | to | verify | this | dependency | among | the | member | states | of | the | European | Union

Economic | phenomena | can | be | explained | using | different | methods | Commonly | used | approaches | include | analytical | description | model | approach | and | synthetic | measures | Synthetic | measures | allow | quantifying | a | phenomenon | described | by | a | considerable | number | of | features | by | means | of | a | single | value | The | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | in | the | countries | of | the | European | Union | in | the | context | of | international | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | products | was | evaluated | using | a | synthetic | measure | designed | using | TOPSIS | Technique | for | Order | Preference | by | Similarity | to | an | Ideal | Solution | This | method | synthesizes | factors | of | various | nature | and | assigns | them | a | synthetic | aggregate | measure | The | features | describing | the | competitive | potential | were | selected | on | the | basis | of | substantive | and | statistical | analysis | i.e. | it | was | verified | whether | they | were | measurable | available | complete | reliable | and | interpretable | and | whether | the | coefficient | of | variation | was | sufficiently | high | V | 15 | Features | that | were | excessively | correlated | with | one | another | i.e. | for | which | Pearson | 's | correlation | coefficient | exceeded | 0.8 | were | eliminated | Thus | X11 | variable | was | not | included | in | the | final | set | of | factors | In | order | to | normalize | the | features | for | every | 𝑥 | 𝑖𝑘 | 𝑖 | 1 | 2 | 28 | 𝑘 | 1 | 2 | 15 | the | unitarization | procedure | was | used | based | on | the | following | formula

The | evaluation | of | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | was | confronted | with | the | competitive | position | of | the | member | states | of | the | European | Union | in | the | international | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | products | To | this | end | the | index | of | revealed | comparative | advantage | RCA | of | export | was | determined | as | a | relation | of | two | quotients | The | first | one | presents | the | relation | between | food | exports | in | the | specific | country | and | food | exports | in | the | European | Union | whereas | the | otherthe | relation | between | total | commodity | export | in | the | specific | country | to | overall | export | in | the | European | Union

The | revealed | comparative | advantage | RCA | index | was | calculated | taking | into | account | regional | trade | streams | which | made | it | possible | to | indicate | differences | in | the | competitive | position | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | in | EU | countries | within | a | group | and | evaluate | their | trade | performance | from | the | perspective | of | operating | in | a | common | market | and | their | competitiveness | in | comparison | with | other | EU | countries | in | international | trade

The | competitive | position | of | the | countries | of | the | European | Union | was | evaluated | using | the | following | measures | next | to | the | previously | mentioned | RCA | index | share | of | export | of | agricultural | and | food | products | in | overall | export | of | the | country | share | of | respective | countries | in | the | export | intra+extra | of | agricultural | and | food | products | of | the | EU | Trade | Coverage | Ratio | TC | and | Grubel | Lloyd | 's | Intra | Industry | Trade | Ratio | GL | All | calculations | took | into | account | data | covering | extra+intra | EU | export | and | import

Studies | were | carried | out | with | reference | to | Section | 0 | and | 1 | of | the | Standard | International | Trade | Classification | SITC)food | drink | and | tobacco | SITC | 0 | and | 1

The | subjects | of | the | study | were | 28 | member | states | of | the | EU | However | due | to | the | unavailability | of | certain | figures | for | Croatia | the | competitive | potential | of | this | country | was | evaluated | only | for | the | year | 2017 | The | time | range | of | the | study | is | 2007 | 2017

Tables | 1 | and | 2 | present | statistical | characteristics | of | diagnostic | variables | taken | into | account | respectively | for | the | year | 2007 | and | 2017 | FADN | 2020 | and | EUROSTAT | 2020

The | analysed | variables | were | characterised | by | a | different | level | of | variation | The | coefficient | of | variation | ranged | from | 135 | to | 30 | The | largest | differentiation | between | the | analysed | countries | was | observed | for | variables | X9 | -share | in | the | EU | agricultural | production | and | X1 | -average | area | of | a | farm | The | least | differentiated | feature | was | the | variable | X14

At | the | next | stage | of | the | study | the | aggregate | measure | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | of | respective | countries | was | determined | based | on | diagnostic | variables | adopted | for | the | needs | of | the | study | FADN | 2020 | and | EUROSTAT | 2020

Synthetic | measures | describing | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | exceeded | values | from | 0.157 | to | 0.454 | and | for | most | countries | were | not | higher | than | general | average | The | highest | value | was | recorded | for | the | Netherlands | determined | measure | -0.454 | and | the | lowest | for | Poland | value | of | the | measure | -0.157 | Apart | from | the | Netherlands | the | first | group | of | countries | characterised | by | the | highest | competitive | potential | comprised | Denmark | France | Luxembourg | Slovakia | and | Czech | Republic | Group | II | consists | of | 6 | countries | III | of | 10 | and | IV | of | 5 | In | group | IV | there | were | 4 | countries | admitted | to | the | EU | in | 2004 | or | later | and | Portugal

The | allocation | of | Portugal | to | the | class | with | the | lowest | competitive | potential | is | a | result | of | among | other | things | low | level | of | capital | expenditure | relatively | low | level | of | technical | equipment | in | this | sector | low | labour | and | land | productivity | Studies | by | Nowak | and | Kamińska | 2016 | show | that | this | country | is | one | of | the | least | competitive | countries | in | terms | of | the | level | of | agricultural | development | The | low | rank | of | Poland | Bulgaria | Romania | and | Lithuania | is | a | consequence | of | among | other | things | structural | problems | of | the | agricultural | sector | and | low | productivity | of | production | factors | Csaki | and | Jambor | 2009 | FADN | 2020 | and | EUROSTAT | 2020

In | 2017 | the | value | of | the | synthetic | measure | ranged | from | 0.469 | in | the | Netherlands | to | 0.155 | in | Poland | Its | average | value | reached | 0.309 | and | only | 12 | countries | exceeded | that | level | The | class | with | the | highest | competitive | potential | next | to | the | Netherlands | included | Slovakia | France | Denmark | as | well | as | Estonia | likewise | in | 2007 | An | improvement | in | the | competitive | potential | of | Estonia | in | comparison | to | 2007 | can | be | explained | among | other | things | by | a | dynamic | increase | in | capital | expenditure | in | agriculture | per | 1 | ha | UAA | and | an | increasing | level | of | technical | equipment | in | agriculture | However | the | share | of | this | country | in | the | agricultural | production | of | the | EU | is | small | and | according | to | EUROSTAT | 2020 | in | 2017 | it | was | only | 0.2 | Slovakia | although | it | is | a | new | member | state | shows | a | high | level | of | the | synthetic | measure | thanks | to | the | fact | that | it | reached | the | maximum | value | of | variables | X1 | X2 | X12 | and | X13 | Class | II | consisted | of | seven | countries | two | of | which | Luxembourg | and | Czech | Republic | in | 2007 | were | included | in | class | I. | Class | III | comprised | 12 | countries | with | a | competitive | potential | below | its | average | level | in | EU-28 | Portugal | Romania | Croatia | and | Poland | were | characterised | by | the | lowest | potential

Hence | Croatia | as | a | country | that | joined | the | EU | as | the | last | out | of | analysed | member | states | in | 2017 | was | not | very | competitive | in | terms | of | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | This | was | due | to | unfavourable | relations | between | production | factors | in | agriculture | as | well | as | a | very | low | productivity | of | labour | and | capital | These | problems | are | noted | among | other | authors | by | Franić | et | al | 2014 | In | addition | Poland | and | Romania | despite | their | low | position | in | the | presented | ranking | have | a | relatively | high | share | in | the | value | of | agricultural | production | that | in | 2017 | amounted | to | 5.8 | and | 3.9 | respectively | The | results | are | presented | graphically | on | Figure | 1 | It | indicates | that | in | 2017 | the | analysed | competitive | potential | did | not | change | much | in | comparison | to | the | year | 2007 | At | the | same | time | large | variations | in | the | value | of | synthetic | measures | can | be | observed | between | member | states | The | difference | between | the | country | with | the | highest | Netherlands | and | the | lowest | Poland | value | of | the | synthetic | measure | was | threefold | in | both | analysed | years

Characterising | the | significance | of | the | EU | in | the | international | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | products | and | the | competitive | position | of | EU | countries | within | a | specific | group | the | following | indicators | are | worth | taking | into | account | their | share | in | intra+extra | EU | export/ | EU | Export | Market | Share | EMS | Revealed | Comparative | Advantage | RCA | in | intra+extra | EU | export | and | Trade | Coverage | TC | ratios | calculated | for | extra+intra | EU | trade | streams | in | this | sector | of | the | economy | The | Grubel | Lloyd | Index | GL | reflecting | intra | industry | exchange | intensity | also | provides | interesting | information | about | the | type | of | export | specialization | in | agricultural | and | food | trade | The | significance | of | agricultural | and | food | trade | for | each | of | these | countries | that | is | the | share | of | export | in | this | group | of | commodities | in | their | overall | export | should | also | be | examined

Source | Own | calculations | based | on | FADN | 2020 | and | EUROSTAT | 2020 | In | 2017 | agricultural | and | food | trade | was | the | most | significant | in | Latvia | Denmark | Greece | Lithuania | and | Spain | the | export | share | of | agricultural | and | food | products | in | total | exports | of | those | countries | ranged | from | 14.94 | to | 19.28 | and | the | least | significant | in | Finland | Slovakia | Czech | Republic | Slovenia | and | Germany | 2.55 | 5.32 | In | 2007 | 2017 | the | significance | of | export | of | agricultural | and | food | products | increased | in | nearly | all | EU | countries | apart | from | Cyprus | and | Slovakia | and | most | of | all | in | Romania | increase | in | the | share | of | this | group | of | commodities | in | total | exports | of | 172.05

The | most | important | exporters | of | agricultural | and | food | products | in | the | EU | have | long | been | the | Netherlands | the | largest | countries | of | the | EU | Germany | France | Italy | Spain | and | Belgium | -all | of | them | with | the | share | in | the | intra+extra | EU-28 | exports | of | agricultural | and | food | products | ranging | from | 7.65 | to | 16.32 | in | 2007 | and | 2017 | It | is | worth | emphasizing | that | in | the | analysed | period | the | share | of | most | of | the | abovementioned | countries | in | the | EU | export | market | in | this | sector | of | economy | decreased | except | Spain | and | Italy | while | in | the | first | place | new | member | states | gained | importance | as | exporters | of | agricultural | and | food | products | Poland | clearly | increased | its | share | in | intra+extra | EU28 | exports | to | 5.70 | hence | becoming | an | important | player | in | the | EU | agricultural | and | food | trade | Romania | Bulgaria | Latvia | Poland | Lithuania | and | Czech | Republic | were | characterised | by | the | most | dynamic | increase | of | their | share | in | the | EU | export | market | However | these | economies | except | Poland | are | not | very | significant | in | the | agricultural | and | food | exports | in | the | whole | group | of | countries

In | 2007 | fifteen | EU | countries | showed | comparative | advantage | in | the | export | of | agricultural | and | food | products | compared | with | the | turnover | of | the | EU | while | in | 2017 | their | number | increased | to | 19 | In | the | analysed | period | RCA | in | the | food | sector | improved | nearly | in | all | EU | countries | except | Cyprus | The | largest | increase | was | recorded | in | Romania | Luxembourg | Malta | Sweden | Bulgaria | Latvia | Italy | and | Poland | 2 | TC | above | 100 | means | that | the | specific | country | generates | an | advantage | in | trading | the | analysed | group | of | commodities | 3 | The | Grubel | Lloyd | GL | intra | industry | trade | intensity | ratio | can | range | from | 0 | to | 100 | values | closer | to | 100 | mean | that | intra | industry | trade | in | the | specific | country | is | more | intensive | Source | Own | calculations | based | on | Eurostat | https://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/data/database | However | in | 2017 | the | group | of | countries | having | the | largest | comparative | advantage | in | agricultural | and | food | export | with | RCA | above | 2 | included | Latvia | Denmark | Greece | Lithuania | and | Spain | RCA | was | also | quite | high | from | 1.60 | to | 1.72 | in | Poland | the | Netherlands | Cyprus | Croatia | and | France | The | group | of | countries | without | comparative | advantage | in | the | export | of | food | in | 2017 | consisted | of | Finland | Slovakia | and | Czech | Republic | RCA | from | 0.34 | to | 0.56 | Slovenia | and | Germany | 0.68 | and | 0.72 | and | Sweden | the | United | Kingdom | Hungary | and | Austria | 0.83 | 0.99

In | 2017 | the | group | of | net | exporters | of | agricultural | and | food | products | was | composed | of | 10 | out | of | 28 | EU | countries | one | more | than | in | 2007 | and | the | highest | trade | coverage | 130.59 | 157.05 | was | recorded | for | Ireland | Poland | Denmark | the | Netherlands | Hungary | and | Spain | In | the | analysed | period | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | 2010 | 2011 | 2012 | 2013 | 2014 | 2015 | 2016 | 2017 | the | largest | positive | change | in | TC | was | observed | in | Romania | nearly | 159 | increase | and | in | Greece | Latvia | and | Bulgaria | However | in | 2017 | in | this | group | of | countries | only | Bulgaria | noted | TC | above | 100 | thus | joining | the | group | of | net | exporters | of | food | in | the | EU

In | 2017 | EU | countries | with | the | highest | Grubel | Lloyd | GL | index | were | Italy | Latvia | and | Austria | each | with | GL | index | above | 98 | France | Germany | Bulgaria | Czech | Republic | and | Belgium | each | with | GL | index | from | 91 | to | 95 | A | high | value | of | GL | index | in | these | countries | can | point | to | technological | advancement | and | structural | transformations | in | the | area | of | production | and | consumption | in | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | In | 2007 | 2017 | the | intra | industry | specialisation | increased | in | as | many | as | 21 | EU | countries | and | most | of | all | in | Romania | Greece | Latvia | Portugal | Cyprus | Italy | and | Slovenia | In | the | same | period | in | some | EU | countries | the | significance | of | inter | branch | exchange | of | food | products | increased | It | was | the | case | mainly | in | Finland | Spain | and | Poland | which | may | suggest | that | these | countries | competed | more | based | on | costs | and | prices | than | on | quality | -through | technological | and | structural | changes | The | intersection | of | RCA | and | CPIzi | axes | was | RCA=1 | as | the | limit | of | competitiveness | above | which | a | comparative | advantage | occurs | for | a | specific | country | and | the | arithmetic | mean | of | CPIzi | calculated | for | 27 | EU | countries | except | Croatia | for | the | years | 2007 | and | 2017 | CPIzi | 0.320 | for | 2007 | and | CPIzi=0.314 | for | 2017 | EU | countries | can | be | divided | into | four | groups | according | to | the | adopted | dimensions | The | first | group | comprises | countries | with | a | high | potential | of | agricultural | competitiveness | and | a | high | competitive | position | in | the | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | The | second | group | is | countries | with | a | low | competitive | potential | and | a | high | competitive | position | The | third | group | consists | of | countries | with | both | a | low | competitive | potential | and | a | low | competitive | position | while | the | fourth | group | is | countries | with | a | high | competitive | potential | and | a | low | competitive | position

The | first | group | characterised | by | a | high | competitive | potential | and | a | high | competitive | position | in | 2007 | included | countries | being | the | leaders | of | agricultural | production | and | agricultural | and | food | export | such | as | the | Netherlands | France | Denmark | Belgium | or | Greece | and | Estonia | In | 2017 | Luxembourg | joined | the | group | and | Greece | left | it | The | Benelux | countries | have | the | largest | gross | investment | per | 1 | ha | of | agricultural | land | and | the | highest | labour | and | land | productivity | Land | and | capital | productivity | decreased | in | Greece | which | contributed | to | a | decrease | in | the | competitive | potential | of | agriculture | but | a | high | competitive | position | in | trade | was | maintained | thanks | to | a | considerable | reduction | in | the | costs | of | labour

Three | countries | that | significantly | improved | their | competitive | position | were | transferred | from | group | three | to | group | two | These | were | Romania | Malta | and | Italy | In | 2017 | only | two | countries | Slovenia | and | Finland | remained | in | the | third | group | In | those | countries | agricultural | and | food | export | is | generally | of | little | significance | Germany | increased | its | competitive | potential | of | agriculture | and | moved | from | group | three | to | group | four | This | was | due | to | increasing | the | gross | investment | per | 1 | ha | of | agricultural | land | improving | the | technical | equipment | and | labour | productivity | in | agriculture | and | to | a | smaller | extent | the | productivity | of | land | that | is | still | high | in | comparison | with | other | countries | of | the | EU

The | competitive | position | of | Germany | in | agricultural | and | food | trade | improved | only | to | a | small | extent | in | comparison | to | the | increase | in | the | competitive | potential | of | agriculture | which | is | due | to | the | fact | that | Germany | is | a | traditional | importer | of | food | and | the | food | export | share | in | the | total | exports | of | this | country | is | small | in | comparison | with | countries | such | as | the | Netherlands | Belgium | or | Denmark | The | largest | repositioning | in | the | arrangement | of | the | analysed | variables | can | be | observed | for | Cyprus | which | resulted | from | a | considerable | loss | of | competitive | position | and | for | Latvia | Romania | Malta | Bulgaria | and | Polandthis | in | turn | was | related | to | a | considerable | improvement | in | their | competitive | position | A | definite | majority | of | EU | countries | except | Cyprus | and | Slovakia | improved | their | competitive | position | in | the | international | agricultural | and | food | trade

This | paper | evaluated | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | in | the | countries | of | the | European | Union | in | the | context | of | the | possible | competitive | advantage | in | the | international | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | products | in | 2007 | 2017 | To | this | end | a | synthetic | measure | designed | using | TOPSIS | was | used | which | made | it | possible | to | identify | countries | characterised | by | a | similar | level | of | the | analysed | phenomenon | In | addition | the | competitive | position | of | EU | countries | in | the | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | was | evaluated | in | confrontation | with | the | competitive | potential

The | results | of | research | point | to | a | strong | diversification | of | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | and | food | sector | among | the | member | states | of | the | European | Union | The | value | of | the | synthetic | measure | of | the | country | with | the | highest | level | of | development | of | this | sector | the | Netherlands | was | more | than | three | times | higher | than | in | the | country | that | was | the | least | competitive | in | that | respect | Slovenia | Disparities | can | also | be | observed | in | the | competitive | potential | of | the | agricultural | sector | between | countries | of | the | so | called | old | EU | and | countries | that | joined | the | EU | in | 2004 | and | later | A | low | competitive | potential | of | those | countries | is | largely | due | to | the | structural | problems | of | agriculture | and | low | productivity | of | the | production | factors | New | member | states | of | the | EU | despite | their | low | competitive | potential | measured | using | zi | measure | designed | in | this | paper | have | quite | a | high | competitive | position | and | their | competitive | advantage | can | be | due | to | the | fact | that | they | compete | by | means | of | other | factors | -mostly | costs | and | prices

However | this | type | of | advantage | does | not | provide | grounds | for | effective | competition | in | the | long | run | Thus | in | most | of | these | countries | transformations | of | agricultural | structures | should | foster | maintaining | and | improving | the | competitive | position | in | the | international | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | products | An | important | role | in | boosting | the | dynamics | of | these | processes | should | be | assigned | to | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | Mucha | Leszko | 2004 | the | instruments | of | which | should | to | a | larger | extent | refer | to | changes | in | the | level | of | employment | in | agriculture | improvement | in | the | agrarian | structure | and | modernisation | of | farms

The | largest | increase | in | the | synthetic | measure | of | the | competitive | potential | of | agriculture | can | be | noted | in | the | following | countries | Slovakia | Belgium | Bulgaria | Lithuania | Estonia | and | Sweden | The | largest | decrease | in | the | measure | was | observed | for | Greece | Ireland | Romania | Luxembourg | and | Czech | Republic | In | turn | the | largest | negative | change | in | the | Revealed | Comparative | Advantage | RCA | was | recorded | for | Cyprus | where | a | considerable | decrease | in | the | competitive | position | occurred | in | international | agricultural | and | food | trade | The | largest | improvement | in | the | competitive | position | can | be | noted | for | Latvia

The | competitive | position | of | Romania | Malta | Bulgaria | Poland | and | Luxembourg | also | considerably | improved | The | new | member | states | of | the | European | Unionthe | so | called | EU-12recorded | the | largest | movements | in | the | system | of | RCA | and | CPIzi | coordinates | These | countries | generally | had | large | capabilities | of | improving | the | competitive | potential | of | agriculture | measured | using | the | aggregate | measure | zi | in | this | paper | in | comparison | with | the | countries | of | the | so | called | old | Union | EU-15 | already | showing | high | efficiency | of | utilizing | their | resources | An | increase | in | the | competitive | potential | of | agriculture | in | comparison | to | the | leading | countries | such | as | the | Netherlands | Belgium | Denmark | or | France | can | have | a | positive | impact | on | the | competitive | position | in | the | agricultural | and | food | trade | of | new | member | states | of | the | EU | that | is | already | relatively | high | considering | the | competitive | capacity | measured | in | this | paper | using | the | aggregate | measure | zi

The | added | value | of | the | research | and | its | contribution | to | literature | on | the | competitiveness | of | international | trade | is | demonstrated | by | the | adopted | synthetic | measure | designed | on | a | broad | range | of | variables | describing | the | competitive | potential | and | its | relationship | with | the | international | trade | performance | An | additional | advantage | of | the | studies | in | their | subjective | scope | comprising | a | group | of | 28 | countries | of | the | European | Union

Considering | that | competitiveness | is | a | complex | and | multi | faceted | issue | further | studies | should | focus | on | finding | factors | that | to | the | largest | extent | determine | the | efficient | utilization | of | the | competitive | potential | in | agriculture | and | shape | the | competitive | position | in | the | trade | in | agricultural | and | food | products
