The | concept | of | a | bioeconomy | can | be | an | opportunity | for | agricultural | and | rural | development | The | objective | of | this | research | is | to | identify | groups | of | family | farms | which | are | able | to | implement | the | principles | of | this | new | development | model | based | on | a | bioeconomy | and | to | reduce | operating | costs | especially | energy | The | time | scope | of | this | study | covers | the | period | 2004 | 2020 | The | data | source | is | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | On | the | basis | of | the | values | of | output | family | farm | income | cash | flow | net | investment | and | total | inputs | including | energy | costs | the | classes | of | family | farms | are | indicated | The | ranking | is | based | on | geographical | criteria | and | the | results | of | panel | data | models | with | fixed | effects | which | measure | the | relationship | between | energy | costs | and | production | income | cash | flow | and | net | investment | according | to | the | economic | size | of | the | family | farm | The | results | obtained | are | discussed | within | the | framework | of | recommendations | of | the | European | Commission

As | noted | by | the | European | Commission | we | live | in | a | world | of | limited | resources | Global | challenges | climate | change | land | and | ecosystem | degradation | coupled | with | a | growing | population | force | us | to | seek | new | ways | of | producing | and | consuming | that | respect | the | ecological | boundaries | of | our | planet | These | challenges | enforce | an | improvement | and | innovation | in | the | food | products | and | materials | production | and | consumption | within | healthy | ecosystems | through | a | sustainable | bioeconomy | 1

A | bioeconomy | is | the | production | and | use | of | renewable | resources | from | land | and | sea | and | the | use | of | waste | to | make | value | added | products | such | as | food | feed | bio | based | products | and | bioenergy | It | is | a | concept | that | provides | a | blueprint | for | a | more | competitive | renewablesbased | future | for | Europe | This | vision | of | the | future | appreciates | the | value | of | the | many | sectors | that | make | up | the | EU | bioeconomy | and | enables | them | to | become | more | competitive | through | better | use | of | renewable | resources | This | in | turn | will | help | create | new | jobs | growth | and | environmental | benefits | for | Europe | Currently | the | bioeconomy | employs | 9 | of | the | workforce | over | 22 | million | people | 2 | This | sector | in | the | EU | is | worth | an | estimated | 2 | trillion | 3

In | 2006 | the | OECD | presented | a | report | The | Bioeconomy | 2030 | Designing | a | policy | agenda | which | was | eventually | published | in | 2009 | 4 | It | led | to | discussion | that | allowed | the | European | Commission | to | adopt | the | strategy | Innovating | for | Sustainable | Growth | A | Bioeconomy | for | Europe | 5 | on | 13 | February | 2012 | This | strategy | proposes | a | comprehensive | approach | to | address | the | ecological | environmental | energy | food | supply | and | natural | resource | challenges | that | Europe | and | the | whole | world | are | facing | already | today | In | order | to | cope | with | an | increasing | global | population | from | 7 | billion | in | 2012 | to | more | than | 9 | billion | in | 2050 | rapid | depletion | of | many | resources | increasing | environmental | pressures | and | climate | change | Europe | needs | to | radically | change | its | approach | to | production | consumption | processing | storage | recycling | and | disposal | of | biological | resources | According | to | this | strategy | a | bioeconomy | is | a | key | element | for | smart | and | green | growth | in | Europe | Advancements | in | bioeconomy | research | and | innovation | uptake | will | allow | Europe | to | improve | the | management | of | its | renewable | biological | resources | and | to | open | new | and | diversified | markets | in | food | and | bio | based | products | These | solutions | have | a | great | potential | in | Europe | Development | of | the | bioeconomy | sector | can | maintain | and | create | economic | growth | and | jobs | in | rural | coastal | and | industrial | areas | reduce | fossil | fuel | dependence | and | improve | the | economic | and | environmental | sustainability | of | primary | production | and | processing | industries | 5

Nowadays | increased | use | of | renewable | resources | is | no | longer | just | an | option | it | is | a | necessity | The | European | economy | must | drive | the | transition | from | a | fossil | based | to | a | biobased | society | with | research | and | innovation | as | the | motor | This | new | model | of | development | approach | combines | scientific | research | and | innovation | including | a | wide | range | of | disciplines | such | as | agronomy | ecology | food | processing | engineering | biotechnology | chemistry | genetics | economics | and | the | social | sciences | The | strategy | addresses | the | production | of | renewable | biological | resources | and | their | conversion | into | vital | products | ranging | from | food | and | feed | to | bio | based | products | and | bioenergy | 6

It | should | be | emphasized | that | the | bioeconomy | is | a | cross | sectoral | form | of | activities | affecting | economic | development | Today | Europe | 's | transition | to | an | oil | independent | economy | is | not | just | a | possibility | but | an | urgent | necessity | Change | should | be | driven | by | scientific | research | innovation | and | large | and | small | scale | investment

Currently | a | very | important | problem | is | the | uneven | distribution | of | natural | resources | especially | minerals | which | are | the | main | sources | of | energy | It | is | dangerous | when | a | few | countries | have | a | high | consumption | which | can | no | longer | be | excluded | International | raw | material | and | energy | dependencies | are | becoming | an | element | of | pressure | and | may | be | the | cause | of | socio | economic | crises | 7 | Now | energy | is | considered | the | driving | force | of | every | action | The | control | over | energy | flow | determines | the | ruling | power | of | human | beings | and | their | relative | influence | on | nature | and | it | models | the | form | of | economic | systems | In | addition | it | affects | the | individual | lifestyle | of | human | being | The | significant | role | of | energy | is | confirmed | by | the | essential | positive | interrelation | between | its | consumption | and | the | economic | growth | or | economic | activity | It | can | be | measured | in | macro | and | micro | scale | 8 | Family | farms | should | play | a | significant | role | in | the | implementation | of | the | bioeconomy | strategy | including | renewable | energy | because | they | are | an | important | link | in | the | agricultural | production | sector | between | traditional | and | modern | instruments | of | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | These | farms | are | engaged | in | the | production | of | agricultural | products | providing | at | the | same | time | rural | areas | with | a | chance | for | multidirectional | development | However | their | efficient | operation | and | willingness | to | try | and | introduce | new | solutions | depends | on | their | financial | situation | When | households | associated | with | farms | do | not | have | problems | with | meeting | their | basic | needs | they | may | focus | on | production | modernization | e.g. | by | implementing | photovoltaics | using | hybrid | cars | or | biofuels | It | seems | necessary | therefore | that | family | farms | should | receive | a | significant | income | from | the | production | of | the | farm | allowing | them | to | build | their | own | cash | resources | that | may | be | invested | The | objective | of | this | research | is | to | identify | a | group | of | family | farms | which | are | able | to | implement | the | principles | of | this | new | development | model | and | implement | the | abovementioned | energy | cost | reduction | The | interdependence | between | energy | cost | and | financial | situation | of | agricultural | farms | has | not | yet | been | analyzed | in | the | literature | This | is | the | first | approach | to | estimate | the | above | mentioned | interdependence | using | the | panel | model | regression | with | fixed | effects

According | to | the | European | Commission | the | bioeconomy | includes | those | parts | of | the | economy | that | use | renewable | biological | resources | from | land | to | sea | such | as | plants | forests | fish | animals | and | microorganisms | to | produce | food | materials | and | energy | It | is | an | important | alternative | to | the | current | mining | based | economy | and | can | be | seen | as | the | next | wave | in | economic | development | It | will | bring | opportunities | for | innovation | jobs | and | growth | and | contribute | to | the | reindustrialization | of | Europe | 9 | The | bioeconomy | is | often | understood | as | a | concept | that | covers | all | sectors | and | systems | that | rely | on | biological | resources | animals | plants | micro | organisms | and | derived | biomass | including | organic | waste | their | functions | and | principles | It | includes | and | interlinks | land | and | marine | ecosystems | and | the | services | they | provide | all | primary | production | sectors | that | use | and | produce | biological | resources | agriculture | forestry | fisheries | and | aquaculture | and | all | economic | and | industrial | sectors | that | use | biological | resources | and | processes | to | produce | food | feed | bio | based | products | energy | and | services

To | be | successful | the | European | bioeconomy | needs | to | focus | on | sustainability | and | circularity | This | will | drive | the | renewal | of | industries | the | modernization | of | primary | production | systems | the | protection | of | the | environment | and | will | enhance | biodiversity | 1 | The | concepts | of | both | the | bioeconomy | and | the | circular | economy | have | been | introduced | in | the | European | Union | EU | in | response | to | concerns | about | the | long | term | viability | of | the | prevailing | resource | intensive | economic | model

These | solutions | are | different | in | origin | the | bioeconomy | is | mostly | driven | by | an | innovation | agenda | and | the | circular | economy | by | environmental | concerns | and | resource | scarcity | However | both | aim | to | contribute | to | strategic | and | operational | EU | policy | objectives | such | as | those | described | in | the | Seventh | Environment | Action | Programme | 7th | EAP | for | living | well | within | the | ecological | limits | of | the | planet | the | report | Transforming | our | world | the | United | Nations | 2030 | Agenda | for | Sustainable | Development | and | the | New | Innovation | Agenda | of | the | European | Union | 10 | 11 | 12 | 13 | The | Bioeconomy | Strategy | of | the | EU | 2013 | and | the | Circular | Economy | Action | Plan | first | version | in | 2015 | in | 2019 | the | EC | adopted | a | comprehensive | report | on | the | implementation | of | the | action | plan | both | identify | food | waste | biomass | and | bio | based | products | as | areas | of | intervention | 6 | 14 | These | documents | also | share | some | common | concepts | such | as | the | chain | approach | sustainability | biorefining | and | the | cascading | use | of | biomass | in | the | way | of | converging | with | respect | to | economic | and | environmental | concerns | research | and | innovation | and | societal | transition | towards | sustainability | 11

The | primary | production | agriculture | forestry | fisheries | and | aquaculture | and | industrial | sectors | using | and/or | processing | biological | resources | food | pulp | and | paper | industries | and | parts | of | the | chemical | biotechnological | and | energy | industries | are | at | the | center | of | a | sustainable | development | that | delivers | strong | communities | by | creating | a | flourishing | economy | that | respects | the | environment | The | reducing | dependence | on | fossil | fuels | and | finite | materials | without | overexploiting | renewable | resources | preventing | biodiversity | loss | and | land | use | change | regenerating | the | environment | these | activities | pave | the | way | of | development | Additionally | creating | new | economic | growth | and | jobs | and | leveraging | on | local | diversities | and | traditions | in | particular | in | the | rural | coastal | and | industrial | areas | is | very | important | 15 | 16 | Assuming | that | these | changes | are | successful | they | will | promote | the | European | Union | 's | economy | as | low | carbon | and | will | contribute | in | the | future | to | the | growth | of | organic | production | and | the | mitigation | of | climate | change | Such | changes | will | also | help | adapt | production | systems | to | produce | lower | greenhouse | gas | emissions | 17 | 18

Europe | has | a | vision | of | a | modern | competitive | prosperous | and | climate | neutral | economy | The | aim | of | this | long | term | strategy | is | to | confirm | Europe | 's | commitment | to | leading | global | climate | action | and | to | present | a | vision | that | can | lead | to | achieving | net | zero | greenhouse | gas | emissions | by | 2050 | through | a | socially | fair | transition | in | a | cost | efficient | manner | This | is | an | opportunity | that | this | transformation | offers | to | European | citizens | and | its | economy | whilst | identifying | challenges | ahead | 19 | It | should | be | underlined | that | the | increased | use | of | energy | from | renewable | sources | also | has | a | fundamental | part | to | play | in | promoting | the | security | of | energy | supply | sustainable | energy | at | affordable | prices | technological | development | and | innovation | as | well | as | technological | and | industrial | leadership | 20 | In | order | to | achieve | these | targets | Europe | provides | a | stable | legal | framework | to | foster | the | necessary | investment | but | this | is | a | long | term | perspective | with | its | 2050 | long | term | climate | neutrality | strategy | the | EU | is | also | looking | further | ahead | than | 2030 | setting | the | foundations | for | what | a | cleaner | planet | will | look | like | by | the | middle | of | the | century | and | beyond | 21 | The | EU | has | been | working | for | decades | to | improve | the | climate | and | the | environment | for | example | improving | air | quality | by | controlling | emissions | of | harmful | substances | into | the | atmosphere | improving | fuel | quality | and | by | integrating | environmental | protection | requirements | into | the | transport | industrial | and | energy | sectors | 22 | Now | the | European | Green | Deal | is | a | response | to | tackling | climate | and | environmentalrelated | challenges | This | new | growth | strategy | aims | to | transform | the | EU | into | a | fair | and | prosperous | society | with | a | modern | resource | efficient | and | competitive | economy | 23 | According | to | the | EU | now | is | this | moment | for | the | world | 's | response | to | the | climate | and | biodiversity | emergencies | This | decade | is | a | make | or | break | moment | for | delivering | on | these | commitments | in | the | interest | of | the | health | wellbeing | and | prosperity | of | all | These | goals | are | no | longer | aspirations | or | ambitions | but | obligations | laid | down | in | the | first | European | Climate | Law | that | create | new | opportunities | for | innovation | investment | and | jobs | 24

Creation | of | a | circular | bioeconomy | capable | of | developing | more | sustainable | products | with | processes | that | use | natural | resources | and | energy | more | efficiently | is | a | huge | challenge | 25 | Now | a | perfect | example | of | circular | bioeconomy | are | processes | applied | in | bioindustries | which | create | smarter | products | based | on | raw | materials | enabling | carbon | to | be | recycled | at | the | end | of | the | product | 's | life | 26 | A | critical | role | in | creating | a | circular | economy | is | played | by | the | biorefineries | where | biomass | including | crops | wood | forest | and | agricultural | residues | are | converted | into | everyday | materials | such | as | chemicals | bioplastic | fuels | food | and | feed | 27 | 28 | It | is | worth | emphasizing | that | industrial | biotechnology | uses | enzymes | and | microorganisms | bacteria | or | fungi | to | make | biobased | products | This | process | plays | a | vital | role | in | transforming | a | biomass | residues | and | CO | 2 | into | everyday | products | This | is | an | alternative | to | using | fossil | carbon | resources | such | as | crude | oil | natural | gas | or | coal | as | the | basic | feedstock | 29 | easing | the | dependence | of | the | contemporary | economy | on | fossil | carbon | burning | oil | and | gas | to | power | homes | industry | and | transport | 30

It | seems | that | rural | areas | will | be | particularly | interested | in | the | development | of | the | bioeconomy | as | well | as | valuable | areas | due | to | their | natural | values | and | peripheral | areas | because | the | implementation | of | its | assumptions | will | transform | the | economies | of | rural | regions | and | their | social | structure | 31 | It | is | worth | noticing | that | in | agriculture | the | economic | processes | are | heavily | dependent | on | the | natural | environment | The | agricultural | sector | plays | a | special | environmental | role | due | its | direct | impact | on | ecosystems | food | safety | and | on | the | condition | of | rural | areas | 32 | It | should | not | be | forgotten | that | agricultural | development | has | been | historically | based | on | the | maximization | of | economic | benefits | profits | or | incomes | at | the | expense | of | the | disequilibrium | in | the | ecological | and | social | system | In | highly | developed | countries | this | agricultural | model | is | stimulated | by | an | agricultural | policy | which | supported | the | quantitative | growth | of | agricultural | production | This | results | in | agricultural | practices | becoming | more | and | more | intensive | while | also | driving | excessive | supply | of | food | and | environmental | degradation | 33

The | development | of | bioeconomy | sectors | represents | an | opportunity | to | promote | innovation | and | job | creation | in | rural | and | industrial | areas | 34 | Therefore | a | circular | bioeconomy | can | be | an | important | pro | development | factor | for | agricultural | farms | 35 | The | potential | inherent | in | human | resources | and | financial | and | infrastructural | capacities | in | the | rural | areas | should | generate | the | development | of | new | types | of | products | and | production | techniques | as | a | result | of | the | application | of | the | principles | of | the | bioeconomy | 36

Taking | the | abovementioned | discussion | into | consideration | it | is | assumed | that | farms | generating | a | sufficiently | high | family | farm | income | having | cash | surpluses | and | being | able | to | renew | their | assets | will | be | primarily | interested | in | introducing | a | new | model | of | development | based | on | the | bioeconomy

This | research | is | based | on | the | data | obtained | from | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | FADN | The | FADN | data | provide | a | detailed | presentation | and | analysis | of | the | main | determinants | of | the | farms | financial | situations | from | the | EU | in | the | years | 2004 | 2020 | Data | for | the | United | Kingdom | from | 2020 | are | also | included | in | this | research

This | database | provides | information | among | others | about | revenues | costs | and | production | conditions | There | are | no | data | on | the | bioeconomy | itself | Unfortunately | one | can | not | find | information | about | the | cost | of | biomass | types | of | fertilizers | production | techniques | however | the | energy | costs | in | farms | can | be | analyzed

It | is | assumed | that | that | family | farms | receive | a | sufficient | income | from | the | production | of | the | farm | have | their | own | cash | resources | and | are | ready | to | invest | and | to | implement | innovation | The | first | step | towards | a | bioeconomy | is | likely | to | be | the | reduction | in | energy | costs

In | order | to | analyze | family | farms | several | variables | are | analyzed | in | EUR

-Output | -Inputs | and | also | energy | costs | -Income | -Cash | flow | -Net | investment

The | study | sought | to | answer | the | following | questions

1

How | much | did | the | European | family | farm | spend | on | energy | between | the | years | 2004 | and | 2020 | and | what | were | at | the | same | time | costs | production | incomes | cash | flows | and | net | investments | 2

In | which | European | country | are | family | farms | are | affected | by | energy | costs | to | the | largest | extent | 3

Does | the | financial | situation | of | farms | in | the | examined | range | differ | depending | on | their | economic | size | 4

Which | financial | categories | output | income | cash | flow | net | investment | interact | with | energy | costs

To | answer | questions | 1 | 3 | the | FADN | data | are | analyzed | In | order | to | answer | to | question | 4 | panel | models | using | the | Gretl | program | are | estimated

The | most | general | formulation | of | a | panel | data | model | can | be | expressed | by | the | following | equation | 37

with | i | i | 1 | N | denoting | individuals | t | t | 1 | T | denoting | time | periods | and | X | i | t | denoting | the | observation | of | K | explanatory | variables | in | country | i | at | time | t. | Parameter | α | i | is | time | invariant | and | accounts | for | any | individual | specific | effect | not | included | in | the | regression | equation | Two | different | interpretations | may | be | given | to | the | α | i | Two | different | basic | models | may | be | distinguished | Fixed | Effect | Panel | Data | Model | FEM | and | Random | Effect | Panel | Data | Model | REM | 38 | In | order | to | choose | between | the | Random | and | Fixed | Effect | Model | the | Hausman | test | was | used | The | idea | is | that | one | uses | the | random | effects | estimates | unless | the | Hausman | test | rejects | it | In | practice | a | failure | to | reject | means | either | that | the | RE | and | FE | estimates | are | sufficiently | close | so | that | it | does | not | matter | which | one | is | used | or | the | sampling | variation | is | so | large | in | the | FE | estimates | that | one | can | not | conclude | practically | significant | differences | are | statistically | significant | 39 | It | should | be | emphasized | that | other | characteristics | of | the | test | sample | should | also | have | an | influence | on | choice | between | these | models | The | estimator | in | the | FE | model | may | not | be | compatible | for | a | short | panel | time | series | but | the | FE | model | appears | to | be | more | appropriate | if | the | analysis | objects | are | not | selected | randomly | and | it | is | important | to | estimate | individual | effects | for | each | object | 40

The | FADN | data | is | not | the | original | data | as | it | is | the | aggregated | average | information | calculated | on | the | basis | of | 15 | farms | with | the | obligation | of | data | secrecy | applied | Taking | this | into | consideration | it | was | decided | to | estimate | the | FE | models | i.e. | models | with | fixed | effects | This | decision | was | supported | by | the | Hausman | test | which | was | used | and | showed | In | addition | the | autocorrelation | test | and | collinearity | analysis | VIF | were | used | to | select | the | relevant | parameters | The | Variance | Inflation | Factors | VIF | were | used | to | measure | the | increase | of | the | variance | of | the | estimated | coefficients | compared | with | the | case | of | no | correlation | among | the | independent | variables | 41

In | the | analyzed | period | in | the | European | Union | the | average | farm | 's | output | was | between | EUR | 60.6 | thousand | in | 2004 | and | EUR | 92.6 | thousand | in | 2020 | The | farms | inputs | were | between | EUR | 53.1 | thousand | and | EUR | 82.7 | thousand | for | the | same | time | Therefore | the | average | family | farm | income | change | was | not | relevant | EUR | 17.9 | thousand | in | 2004 | EUR | 24.3 | thousand | in | 2020 | The | average | energy | costs | by | farm | were | growing | from | EUR | 3.5 | thousand | in | 2004 | to | EUR | 5.6 | thousand | in | 2020 | It | was | about | 6.8 | of | the | total | output | value | At | the | same | time | the | average | farm | 's | cash | flow | increased | from | EUR | 25.1 | thousand | in | 2004 | to | EUR | 34.7 | thousand | in | 2020 | but | the | value | of | net | investment | was | variable | between | EUR | −236 | in | 2016 | and | EUR | 1.8 | thousand | in | 2012 | Table | 1 | It | can | therefore | be | concluded | that | the | financial | situation | of | farms | improved | during | the | period | considered | despite | rising | costs | including | energy | In | addition | energy | costs | grew | more | slowly | than | total | inputs | and | total | output | Figure | 1 | To | highlight | the | countries | with | the | highest | energy | costs | and | other | financial | information | the | ranking | of | farms | was | prepared | according | to | the | country | in | 2020 | Table | 2 | The | highest | energy | costs | per | farm | were | observed | in | Slovakia | Czech | Republic | Netherlands | Germany | Denmark | Sweden | Belgium | Finland | United | Kingdom | and | Estonia | Taking | into | account | the | highest | financial | results | the | financial | situation | of | farms | in | the | following | countries | was | recognized | as | favorable | Slovakia | Czech | Republic | Netherlands | Germany | Denmark | Sweden | Belgium | United | Kingdom | Luxembourg | and | France | but | in | Finland | and | Estonia | the | financial | situation | of | farms | was | not | much | worse | In | this | ranking | farms | To | highlight | the | countries | with | the | highest | energy | costs | and | other | financial | information | the | ranking | of | farms | was | prepared | according | to | the | country | in | 2020 | Table | 2 | The | highest | energy | costs | per | farm | were | observed | in | Slovakia | Czech | Republic | Netherlands | Germany | Denmark | Sweden | Belgium | Finland | United | Kingdom | and | Estonia | Taking | into | account | the | highest | financial | results | the | financial | situation | of | farms | in | the | following | countries | was | recognized | as | favorable | Slovakia | Czech | Republic | Netherlands | Germany | Denmark | Sweden | Belgium | United | Kingdom | Luxembourg | and | France | but | in | Finland | and | Estonia | the | financial | situation | of | farms | was | not | much | worse | In | this | ranking | farms | from | Poland | Slovenia | Portugal | Greece | Croatia | and | Romania | achieved | particularly | low | results | Table | 2 | The | economic | size | which | is | one | of | the | criteria | used | to | classify | agricultural | farms | according | to | the | community | typology | measured | as | the | total | Standard | Output | of | the | farm | in | euro | for | a | reference | period | of | five | successive | years | of | all | farms | increased | in | the | analyzed | period | at | a | similar | pace | Only | the | share | of | energy | cost | in | the | total | output | of | the | farm | was | more | differentiable | Table | 3 | Along | with | the | decrease | of | the | economic | size | of | farm | the | differences | between | cash | flow | and | the | income | tended | to | diminish | and | the | net | investment | tended | to | decrease | Small | farms | did | not | have | the | capacity | to | increase | the | capital | reserves | of | farm

In | order | to | fulfil | the | main | target | of | this | research | forward | stepwise | variable | selection | was | introduced | Using | the | Gretl | Program | the | FE | Models | were | obtained | Table | 4 | In | the | estimated | models | all | variables | are | characterized | by | a | level | of | significance | below | 0.05 | Three | variables | have | a | statistically | significant | influence | on | the | dependent | variable | energy | cost | namely | output | family | farm | income | and | net | investment | The | values | of | VIF | test | for | all | variables | are | low | and | the | autocorrelation | does | not | occur

Among | the | smallest | farms | classes | 1 | 2 | and | 3 | the | impact | on | energy | costs | is | exerted | by | the | total | output | However | in | the | class | of | medium | large | farms | class | 4 | only | the | family | farm | income | has | statistical | importance | The | latter | variable | also | has | a | noticeable | impact | on | the | energy | cost | of | the | largest | sized | farms | classes | 5 | and | 6 | along | with | the | net | investment | Therefore | the | results | obtained | show | that | the | determinants | affecting | the | energy | costs | vary | depending | on | the | economic | size | of | the | farm | The | cash | flow | was | insignificant | statistically | in | all | six | classes | Table | 4 |  | Summing | up | this | part | of | the | research | it | can | be | concluded | that | the | energy | costs | increased | from | year | to | year | in | Europe | but | slower | than | the | increase | in | production | and | inputs | The | largest | farms | with | a | significant | income | from | production | which | are | able | to | invest | bear | also | the | highest | costs | including | energy | costs | This | phenomenon | occurred | in | farms | in | Belgium | Czech | Republic | Denmark | Estonia | Finland | France | Germany | Luxembourg | Netherlands | Slovakia | Sweden | and | United | Kingdom

When | energy | costs | unexpectedly | increase | these | dependencies | gain | a | great | importance | Nowadays | particular | attention | should | be | paid | to | these | results | in | the | context | of | rising | energy | prices

The | results | of | these | studies | should | be | compared | with | the | position | of | the | European | Commission | The | EC | expressed | the | hope | when | developing | the | concept | of | the | bioeconomy | within | the | framework | of | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | and | the | Europe | 2020 | Strategy | that | due | to | the | wide | range | of | impact | of | the | bioeconomy | it | is | possible | to | improve | the | economic | situation | of | farms | including | small | ones | When | considering | the | importance | of | this | issue | the | Commission | 's | Horizon | 2020 | research | program | takes | into | account | the | need | to | increase | public | funding | for | bioeconomy | research | and | innovation | An | amount | of | EUR | 4.5 | billion | has | been | earmarked | for | actions | under | the | challenge | Food | Security | Sustainable | Agriculture | and | Forestry | Marine | and | Maritime | and | Inland | Water | Research | and | the | Bioeconomy | and | complementary | funding | is | foreseen | in | other | areas | of | Horizon | 2020 | 5 | 42 | Part | of | these | funds | will | also | support | the | development | of | farms

Bioeconomy | is | of | high | attractiveness | as | a | potential | solution | for | green | growth | and | competitiveness | 43 | It | is | a | great | opportunity | to | revitalize | productivity | and | growth | by | improving | the | competitiveness | of | domestic | industries | through | new | technologies | and | reducing | dependence | on | imported | raw | materials | by | rehabilitating | marginalized | areas | 44 | 45 | Especially | in | the | European | Economic | Community | countries | could | play | a | special | role | in | focusing | green | investments | The | processing | sectors | including | food | and | feed | still | lag | behind | Their | economies | are | between | the | low | and | moderate | innovators | and | substantial | progress | depends | on | their | modernization | Additionally | global | challenges | do | require | new | priorities | on | modernization | which | is | implemented | with | the | help | of | new | funding | mechanisms | New | projects | in | these | countries | could | provide | unique | opportunities | for | progress | if | the | countries | focus | their | investments | A | bioeconomy | could | create | viable | rural | areas | if | special | focus | is | set | on | national | operational | programs | and | national | research | and | innovation | strategies | for | bioeconomies | 46 | but | we | should | note | that | since | the | concept | of | a | bioeconomy | emerged | in | the | political | agenda | its | contribution | to | the | economy | has | been | estimated | for | different | points | over | time | and | across | locations | 47

In | microeconomic | terms | we | must | remember | that | the | transformation | towards | a | circular | economy | poses | significant | challenges | for | established | companies | in | many | cases | requiring | a | strong | modification | of | their | current | business | models | start | ups | and | new | ventures | Firms | need | to | completely | rethink | their | value | proposition | modifying | how | the | product | or | service | is | produced | delivered | to | the | customers | and | disposed | of | 48 | Still | we | are | not | seeing | widespread | adoption | of | circular | business | models | based | on | remanufacturing | and | reuse | which | promise | significant | cost | savings | as | well | as | radical | reductions | in | environmental | impact | in | industry | 49 | The | entrepreneurs | saw | their | contribution | to | sustainable | development | primarily | in | the | generation | of | new | knowledge | and | employment | The | ecological | or | social | motives | were | less | frequently | reported | 50 | In | a | future | circular | economy | new | business | models | are | needed | that | slow | close | and | narrow | resource | loops | to | address | key | resource | and | climate | challenges | We | should | remember | that | after | a | phase | of | excitement | and | inspiration | an | operationalization | phase | needs | to | start | to | ensure | the | best | possible | implementation | and | transition | towards | a | circular | economy | This | operationalization | phase | will | involve | the | development | of | products | processes | and | business | models | that | significantly | lower | the | negative | impact | on | the | environment | reduce | waste | and | resource | pressures | and | create | a | positive | impact | on | society | and | environment | 51

The | recognition | of | the | full | potential | of | biotechnological | research | and | innovation | for | the | economy | and | society | as | a | whole | is | a | concept | which | has | been | promoted | over | the | last | twenty | years | by | the | Netherlands | Germany | and | Finland | countries | pioneering | in | biotechnologies | 52 | Today | more | than | 50 | countries | have | a | dedicated | bioeconomy | strategy | or | related | policies | While | a | bioeconomy | is | consistent | with | sustainability | policy | synergy | must | be | ensured | to | avoid | over | exploitation | of | natural | resources | and | conflicting | global | needs | 53 | Countries | are | formulating | strategies | in | accordance | with | their | goals | to | attain | a | bioeconomy | therefore | proper | measurement | monitoring | and | reporting | of | the | outcomes | of | these | strategies | are | crucial | for | long | term | success | 54

As | the | priority | fields | of | bioeconomy | strategies | lose | their | ecological | focus | and | acquire | a | social | and | at | the | same | time | capitalist | vision | priorities | now | focus | on | economic | growth | gross | value | added | entrepreneurship | competitiveness | employment | and | technology | development | Future | research | has | been | suggested | to | avoid | some | of | the | previous | trends | such | as | the | focus | on | biodiversity | the | development | of | remote | regions | and | agroecological | systems | It | is | also | important | to | carry | out | future | research | on | the | training | of | bioeconomy | participants | and | to | include | education | as | a | priority | in | strategies | 55

It | should | be | remembered | that | a | lack | of | long | term | political | commitment | and | incentives | means | that | development | of | a | bioeconomy | will | slow | down | The | investments | and | high | qualified | workforce | can | be | relocated | to | regions | which | are | more | supportive | e.g. | the | United | States | Thus | a | potential | job | and | innovation | growth | in | Europe | can | be | endangered | Therefore | it | is | worth | taking | care | of | political | solutions | at | the | level | of | the | European | Union | and | member | states | in | the | long | term

We | must | remember | that | in | the | near | future | bioeconomy | policy | development | will | require | a | much | broader | policy | mix | aligned | with | national | challenges | and | missions | and | aimed | at | enabling | innovation | experimentation | diffusion | and | networking | as | well | as | facilitating | structural | economic | change | 56 | Bioeconomy | governance | is | crucial | to | maximize | synergetic | effects | of | sectoral | policies | creating | a | level | playing | field | It | is | also | important | to | frame | coherent | sustainability | criteria | across | policy | areas | Fostering | inter | ministerial | cooperation | policy | coherence | and | vertical | coordination | at | local | national | EU | and | international | levels | allows | the | bioeconomy | to | fulfil | its | potential | 57

Finally | it | is | worth | noting | that | some | Member | States | of | the | European | Union | including | Denmark | Finland | the | Netherlands | and | Germany | have | already | introduced | national | strategies | for | the | bioeconomy | Internationally | China | Canada | South | Africa | and | the | US | have | or | are | developing | ambitious | strategies | in | this | area | That | is | why | it | is | important | that | farms | even | small | ones | are | willing | to | introduce | new | production | solutions | Unfortunately | without | a | satisfactory | income | with | a | lack | of | net | investment | they | can | focus | only | on | current | consumption | and | ensuring | the | survival | of | the | farm | This | may | translate | into | a | reluctance | towards | the | proposed | changes | aimed | at | popularizing | the | bioeconomy

The | results | of | this | study | determine | the | interdependence | between | energy | costs | and | the | financial | situation | of | farms | They | may | break | some | misperceptions | on | environmental | sustainability | and | the | use | of | energy | in | implementation | of | the | bioeconomy | strategy | in | agriculture | The | knowledge | of | eco | misperceptions | is | useful | for | increasing | the | eco | knowledge | to | apply | the | methods | correctly | and | to | not | replicate | the | errors | 58 | In | addition | the | energy | productivity | and | potential | for | a | better | consideration | of | important | environmental | factors | of | a | technological | agriculture | may | be | underestimated | 59 | Optimization | of | energy | improves | energy | use | efficiency | and | input | costs | 60 | but | it | is | dependent | on | the | type | of | farm | production | 61 | 62 | or | even | on | the | different | barn | planning | systems | 63 | Other | factors | may | also | have | an | impact | on | energy | productivity | and | efficiency | For | example | farmers | education | access | to | agricultural | information | and | training | in | wheat | production | significantly | improve | this | efficiency | whereas | phenomena | such | as | a | delay | in | planting | and | first | fertilization | significantly | reduce | it | 64 | This | research | clearly | shows | that | the | higher | the | economic | size | of | farm | the | weaker | the | link | between | energy | costs | and | output | and | the | stronger | the | link | between | these | costs | and | income | as | well | as | net | investment | Therefore | decisions | of | farms | may | depend | on | their | size | and | not | on | the | recommended | EU | strategy

We | must | remember | that | saving | energy | i.e. | reducing | energy | consumption | through | price | signals | energy | efficiency | measures | or | voluntary | efforts | can | often | be | the | cheapest | safest | and | cleanest | way | to | reduce | reliance | on | fossil | fuel | imports | from | Russia | Moreover | using | less | energy | supports | security | of | supply | facilitates | storage | requirements | and | underpins | the | clean | energy | transition | 65 | However | other | development | goals | may | be | important | for | farmers | or | their | actions | may | be | determined | by | factors | other | than | the | strategy | imposed | by | politicians

The | bioeconomy | is | a | series | of | changes | affecting | all | sectors | that | produce | process | or | use | biological | resources | This | is | an | important | solution | for | the | future | of | the | agricultural | sector | and | improving | its | competitiveness | If | it | is | assumed | that | the | introduction | of | bioeconomy | rules | is | an | opportunity | to | improve | the | economic | conditions | for | agricultural | operators | it | is | obvious | that | it | requires | them | to | incur | expenditures | on | the | implementation | of | new | solutions | This | paper | assumes | that | higher | income | commodity | farms | able | to | invest | and | generate | a | positive | cash | flow | will | be | more | likely | to | do | so

The | survey | was | carried | out | encompassing | 28 | European | Union | countries | including | the | UK | between | 2004 | and | 2020 | using | representative | FADN | data | for | family | farms | The | research | shows | that | farms | from | Belgium | Czech | Republic | Denmark | Estonia | Finland | France | Germany | Luxembourg | Netherlands | Slovakia | Sweden | and | United | Kingdom | may | be | most | inclined | to | introduce | bioeconomy | principles | They | have | on | average | higher | results | in | terms | of | their | production | income | ability | to | self | finance | savings | cash | flow | and | assets | restoration | net | investment | This | is | accompanied | by | higher | inputs | including | energy | costs | The | least | inclined | to | new | implementations | may | be | the | economically | weakest | farms | from | countries | such | as | Croatia | Greece | Poland | Portugal | Romania | and | Slovenia

In | addition | larger | farms | EUR | 50 | 000 | and | more | of | Standard | Production | classes | 4 | 6 | may | be | interested | in | new | bioeconomy | principles | Their | farm | net | income | and | cash | flow | were | higher | than | the | average | results | observed | in | EU | countries | These | farms | were | capable | of | investing | because | a | positive | value | of | net | investment | occurred

It | should | also | be | noted | that | the | following | pattern | is | observed | the | higher | the | economic | size | of | farm | the | weaker | the | link | between | energy | costs | and | output | and | the | stronger | link | between | these | costs | and | income | as | well | as | net | investment

In | conclusion | it | can | be | noted | that | the | selection | of | potential | economic | determinants | affecting | farm | energy | costs | depends | on | the | adopted | research | perspective | This | is | an | opportunity | for | new | research | in | this | field | as | well | as | for | adopting | new | research | perspectives | and | instruments | similar | to | the | panel | fixed | effect | models | used | in | this | article | to | analyze | farms | according | to | their | economic | size

There | are | some | limitations | of | the | conducted | analysis | however | This | research | is | based | on | the | FADN | database | that | provides | only | average | information | calculated | on | the | basis | of | a | limited | sample | of | farms | from | each | country | This | database | does | not | include | all | agricultural | farms | in | analyzed | countries | Moreover | this | dataset | includes | only | agricultural | farms | that | keep | their | accounts | according | to | the | FADN | requirements | This | means | that | some | agricultural | farms | especially | small | ones | are | not | able | to | be | included | in | the | FADN | database | and | the | model | calculated | in | this | research | does | not | take | them | into | account | so | the | achieved | results | may | be | biased | by | the | excessive | presence | of | large | agricultural | farms
