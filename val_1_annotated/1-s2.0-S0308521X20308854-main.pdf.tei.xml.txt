As | the | impact | of | climate | change | on | the | agricultural | sector | has | begun | to | manifest | itself | in | its | severity | adaptation | planning | has | come | under | scrutiny | for | favoring | the | preservation | of | status | quo | conditions | over | more | substantial | changes | The | uptake | of | transformational | adaptations | involving | a | significant | re | structuring | of | the | agricultural | system | is | however | hindered | by | a | lack | of | assessment | tools | capable | of | quantifying | the | effects | of | these | often | more | complex | far | reaching | and | unprecedented | changes | Agent | based | models | can | simulate | decision | processes | and | multi | level | feedbacks | between | system | components | and | may | therefore | illustrate | how | transformational | adaptations | emerge | and | help | identify | cases | where | their | implementation | is | necessary | and | desirable | We | explore | this | modelling | potential | and | aim | to | quantify | 1 | how | climate | change | farmer | behavior | and | water | policies | may | influence | strategic | adaptation | decision | making | at | the | farm | level | 2 | the | extent | to | which | implemented | adaptations | represent | transformations | and | 3 | their | impact | on | farm | structure | and | wider | socio | ecological | change | We | investigate | these | aims | through | a | case | study | of | crop | farming | systems | in | the | drought | prone | historical | region | of | Romagna | NE | Italy | integrating | insight | from | stakeholder | interviews | local | reports | spatially | explicit | biophysical | data | and | behavioral | theory | in | the | construction | of | an | agent | based | model | Results | show | that | on | average | more | than | half | of | all | implemented | adaptations | are | transformations | thereby | requiring | important | social | and | financial | investments | from | farmers | The | number | of | implemented | transformations | is | highest | in | scenarios | where | drought | risk | perception | among | farmers | is | more | widespread | notably | in | scenarios | simulating | drier | climates | more | adaptive | behaviors | and | policies | promoting | greater | water | use | efficiency | Under | higher | drought | risk | perception | farmers | are | motivated | to | explore | a | broader | set | of | adaptations | including | those | outside | of | the | trajectory | determined | by | their | farming | strategy | This | process | particularly | favors | the | implementation | of | transformational | increases | in | farm | size | and | irrigated | area | eventually | stimulating | farmers | to | adopt | an | expansionist | strategy | Regionally | these | adaptations | lead | to | the | smallest | decline | in | agricultural | extent | with | fewest | yet | highest | profit | earning | farmers | largely | exacerbating | presently | occurring | trends | Under | policy | scenarios | simulating | increased | irrigation | availability | fewer | farmers | initially | experience | drought | and | therefore | perceive | a | drought | risk | Consequently | fewer | farmers | undertake | transformational | adaptations | and | switch | from | a | contractive | to | an | expansive | strategy | culminating | in | a | relatively | smaller | and | less | profitable | agricultural | extent | despite | a | larger | farmer | population | As | transformative | changes | to | farming | strategy | trigger | farmers | to | engage | in | new | path | dependencies | aims | of | water | policies | may | therefore | rebound | into | unintended | effects | emphasizing | the | importance | of | accounting | for | transformational | perspectives

Growing | recognition | of | the | impact | and | rate | of | climate | change | has | shifted | the | discourse | on | climate | action | and | drawn | increased | attention | to | the | development | of | adaptation | plans | Pielke | et | al | 2007 | In | 2013 | the | European | Commission | published | and | adopted | the | EU | Strategy | on | Adaptation | to | Climate | Change | calling | on | member | states | to | formulate | multi | level | adaptation | strategies | and | promote | adaptation | in | key | vulnerable | sectors | Aguiar | et | al | 2018 | European | Commission | 2013 | The | strategy | identified | the | agricultural | sector | as | highly | vulnerable | to | the | adverse | impacts | of | climate | change | Particularly | within | southern | Europe | where | agriculture | is | most | susceptible | to | increased | drought | periods | adaptation | planning | to | sustain | agricultural | productivity | rural | livelihoods | and | ecosystem | functioning | has | been | a | major | subject | of | inquiry | and | critique | Berkhout | et | al | 2015 | European | Commission | 2013

A | central | criticism | has | emphasized | a | preference | within | adaptation | planning | on | initiatives | promoting | short | term | incremental | adjustments | over | more | substantial | transformational | changes | Berkhout | et | al | 2015 | Rickards | and | Howden | 2012 | Vermeulen | et | al | 2018 | While | incremental | adjustments | are | suited | to | farmer | experientially | guided | decisionmaking | they | often | maintain | the | defining | properties | of | an | existing | system | and | may | therefore | insufficiently | address | the | unprecedented | challenges | posed | by | climate | change | Vermeulen | et | al | 2018 | Incremental | adjustments | are | especially | unlikely | to | provide | effective | results | in | areas | where | their | potential | is | already | saturated | Kates | et | al | 2012 | In | southern | Europe | historical | expansion | of | irrigation | has | resulted | in | regions | where | more | than | 50 | of | utilized | agricultural | area | is | currently | irrigated | Eurostat | 2019 | With | water | availability | for | agriculture | expected | to | decrease | due | to | rising | environmental | awareness | and | economic | development | alongside | climatic | changes | Iglesias | and | Garrote | 2015 | the | long | term | sustainability | of | adjustment | approaches | aimed | at | safeguarding | on | farm | water | supply | to | water | intensive | crops | is | increasingly | being | questioned | Stein | et | al | 2016

Transformational | adaptation | approaches | thus | require | consideration | Rickards | and | Howden | 2012 | Several | definitions | of | such | approaches | have | recently | been | proposed | primarily | defining | transformational | adaptations | as | major | changes | to | system | components | or | perspectives | which | occur | when | system | thresholds | are | breached | Panda | 2018 | To | operationalize | the | concept | Vermeulen | et | al | 2018 | proposed | a | definition | which | focuses | solely | on | the | outcomes | of | transformative | processes | defining | transformational | adaptations | as | those | resulting | in | a | substantial | redistribution | in | at | least | one | third | of | an | agricultural | system | 's | primary | factors | of | production | outputs | or | outcomes | within | a | period | of | 25 | years | or | less | At | the | farm | scale | examples | of | such | transformational | adaptation | include | substantial | changes | to | crop | production | re-)allocation | of | water | resources | on | farm | income | diversifications | and | relocation | According | to | this | definition | transformational | adaptations | can | either | be | autonomously | implemented | by | farmers | or | externally | driven | by | policy

The | implications | of | transformational | adaptations | as | opposed | to | adjustments | are | significant | Transformational | adaptations | comprise | more | substantial | transaction | costs | financial | or | social | and | may | be | more | difficult | to | reverse | and | induce | maladaptive | outcomes | as | changes | to | goals | or | perspectives | establish | new | path | dependencies | Rickards | and | Howden | 2012 | Identifying | cases | where | transformational | adaptations | may | be | necessary | or | desirable | is | therefore | important | yet | features | of | nonlinearity | heterogeneity | and | inconsistency | which | characterize | farm | system | transformations | complicate | this | task | Wilson | 2008 | In | light | of | this | challenge | modelling | tools | have | been | proposed | as | a | means | to | facilitate | the | exploration | of | transformational | adaptation | by | illustrating | the | outcomes | of | system | interlinkages | and | by | providing | deductive | tools | for | exploring | different | strategies | Brown | et | al | 2017 | Holman | et | al | 2018 | Huet | et | al | 2018 | In | contrast | to | commonly | used | top | down | global | and | regional | macroeconomic | modelling | studies | relying | on | aggregate | information | agent | based | models | ABMs | have | emerged | as | particularly | suitable | models | for | the | comprehensive | exploration | of | adaptation | dynamics | and | transformational | change | An | 2012 | Berger | and | Troost | 2014 | Huet | et | al | 2018 | Parker | et | al | 2003 | Rounsevell | et | al | 2012 | The | potential | of | ABMs | lies | in | their | capacity | to | 1 | simulate | individual | decision | making | capturing | the | influence | of | different | strategic | farming | goals | and | perspectives | and | 2 | address | interlinkages | accounting | for | multi | scalar | drivers | and | temporal | feedbacks | between | individuals | and | their | institutional | and | biophysical | contexts | Matthews | et | al | 2007 | Wens | et | al | 2019

By | means | of | a | case | study | we | hereby | utilize | this | modelling | potential | for | the | exploration | of | transformational | adaptations | to | water | scarcity | by | simulating | strategic | decision | making | at | the | farm | scale | Specifically | we | construct | an | ABM | with | the | aim | of | 1 | quantifying | how | future | climate | conditions | farmer | attitudes | and | values | and | local | water | policy | discourses | influence | adaptation | decision | making | at | the | farm | level | 2 | evaluate | the | extent | to | which | implemented | adaptations | represent | transformational | cases | by | adapting | the | definition | of | Vermeulen | et | al | 2018 | and | 3 | quantify | the | implications | of | transformational | adaptation | for | farm | structure | and | socio | ecological | change | We | develop | the | ABM | by | integrating | behavioral | theory | with | findings | from | stakeholder | interviews | and | local | reports | addressing | crop | farming | systems | in | Romagna | a | drought | prone | agricultural | area | comprising | part | of | the | administrative | region | of | Emilia | Romagna | NE | Italy | displaying | trends | of | increased | irrigation | multifunctionality | and | scale | enlargement | characteristic | of | the | broader | national | and | European | context | Rivaroli | et | al | 2017 | Following | a | case | study | description | in | Section | 2 | we | outline | the | processes | of | model | characterization | Section | 3.2 | and | parameterization | Section | 3.3 | Section | 3.4 | presents | an | overview | of | the | climate | behavior | and | water | policy | scenarios | explored | and | is | followed | by | a | presentation | and | discussion | of | the | modelling | results

We | operationalized | the | Modelling | Human | Behavior | MoHuB | framework | of | Schlüter | et | al | 2017 | to | define | the | model | entities | and | processes | Three | principal | entities | are | outlined | in | the | framework | an | external | social | and | biophysical | environment | within | which | agents | make | decisions | individual | agents | with | their | goals | values | and | assets | and | a | set | of | perceived | behavioral | options | which | agents | may | choose | to | perform | These | entities | interact | through | three | consecutive | processes | representing | adaptation | decision | making | farmers | first | update | their | characteristics | based | on | their | perception | of | changes | to | the | external | environment | they | then | select | which | adaptation | to | implement | based | on | its | capacity | to | meet | their | goals | and | lastly | implement | the | selected | adaptation | with | repercussion | to | internal | and | external | characteristics

The | following | sections | outline | the | process | of | model | characterization | and | parameterization | and | present | an | overview | of | the | model | In | Sections | 3.1 | 3.2 | we | outline | how | interviews | with | key | informants | and | farmers | alongside | the | analysis | of | local | literature | were | undertaken | to | characterize | the | model | 's | entities | and | processes | These | findings | were | integrated | with | behavioral | theory | on | adaptation | decision | making | to | further | structure | the | characterization | of | decision | processes | In | Section | 3.3 | we | detail | the | parameterization | of | model | variables | which | used | interview | results | local | literature | and | secondary | biophysical | and | socio | economic | farm | data | The | model | was | run | under | different | scenarios | reflecting | possible | future | changes | to | external | variables | climate | and | water | policy | as | well | as | ESRI | 2020 | European | Environment | Agency | 2016 | Regione | Emilia | Romagna | 2017a | 2017b | 2017c

The | ABM | explores | the | effect | of | changing | climate | water | policy | and | farmer | attitudes | and | values | on | adaptation | decision | making | by | individual | farmers | in | Romagna | A | farmer | 's | annual | decision | making | process | begins | with | a | perceptual | phase | farmers | establish | whether | they | perceive | a | risk | of | future | drought | damage | and | whether | they | perceive | a | possibility | to | adapt | This | process | follows | the | framework | of | Grothmann | and | Patt | 2005 | based | on | the | Protection | Motivation | Theory | Maddux | and | Rogers | 1983 | which | defines | risk | and | adaptation | appraisal | as | the | primary | perceptual | processes | guiding | adaptation | decision | making | Farmers | drought | risk | perceptions | depend | on | their | concern | for | climate | change | and | past | experiences | of | drought | If | a | risk | is | perceived | the | farmer | will | proceed | to | evaluate | possibilities | for | adaptation | and | eventually | implement | the | adaptation | with | the | highest | utility | i.e. | the | adaptation | which | best | fulfills | a | farmer | 's | economic | and | strategic | goals | The | scale | and | nature | of | implemented | adaptations | is | evaluated | to | determine | whether | these | represent | transformational | cases | and | whether | they | involve | a | change | in | production | type | and | strategic | goals | With | each | annual | time | step | the | model | records | the | transformational | adaptations | implemented | by | farmers | as | well | as | the | ensuing | changes | to | Romagna | 's | farm | structure | agricultural | revenues | and | irrigation | consumption

External | environment | influential | external | variables | were | categorized | as | either | economic | policy | biophysical | demographic | or | social | Two | water | policy | trajectories | were | identified | and | primarily | sourced | from | local | reports | and | literature | These | trajectories | aim | to | either | expand | irrigation | supply | through | collectively | managed | LRIC | sources | and | improved | distributional | efficiencies | Zavalloni | et | al | 2014 | or | to | limit | irrigation | demand | by | restricting | the | expansion | of | water | demanding | crops | introducing | withdrawal | quotas | subsidizing | efficient | irrigation | systems | and | increasing | awareness | on | water | use | efficiency | Bagli | 2017 | Regione | Emilia | Romagna | 2009 | Economic | factors | were | stated | in | the | interviews | and | referred | to | farm | finances | Table | 2 | Influential | biophysical | factors | referred | primarily | to | climate | impacts | and | irrigation | water | accessibility | demographic | factors | related | solely | to | the | entry | of | new | farmers | in | Romagna | while | social | factors | referred | to | processes | of | farmer | imitation | or | indirect | competition | for | resources | These | social | factors | are | not | captured | in | the | model | as | external | entities | but | are | instead | represented | through | processes | of | farmer | to | farmer | interaction | Farm(er | characteristics | farmer | goals | were | defined | as | economic | and | strategic | and | identified | in | statements | referencing | different | profit | ambitions | and | farming | strategies | Aspirations | for | profit | changed | from | maximizing | to | satisficing | Gotts | et | al | 2003 | diversifying | and | non | diversifying | orientations | resulting | in | the | identification | of | four | different | strategies | Two | non | diversifying | strategies | were | identified | and | termed | expansive | and | contractive | Wheeler | et | al | 2013 | respectively | illustrating | strategies | centered | on | increasing | or | decreasing | the | use | of | agricultural | resources | The | two | identified | diversifying | strategies | were | termed | broadening | and | deepening | Ploeg | and | Roep | 2003 | A | deepening | strategy | aims | to | increase | the | value | of | agricultural | produce | e.g. | direct | sale | organic | certification | PGI | production | while | a | broadening | strategy | aims | to | increase | farm | income | through | on | farm | non | agricultural | activities | e.g. | agri | tourism | care | farming | Rivaroli | et | al | 2017 | Qualitative | analysis | of | interview | results | additionally | revealed | a | relation | between | a | farmer | 's | climate | change | belief | drought | risk | perception | and | willingness | to | adapt | It | also | outlined | how | farm | characteristics | and | farmer | values | influence | perceived | ability | to | implement | adaptations | Table | 3 | Influential | farmer | values | were | categorized | into | four | dimensions | referencing | the | Theory | of | Basic | Values | Schwartz | 2012 | notably | openness | to | change | vs. | tradition | environmental | conservation | i.e. | self | transcendence | vs. | selfenhancement | collaboration | vs. | autonomy | and | ambition | reflected | within | different | aspired | profits | Table | SI2 | Perceived | adaptation | options | we | classified | the | adaptive | actions | identified | through | interviews | into | seven | adaptations | increasing | or | decreasing | farm | size | expanding | irrigated | area | upgrading | irrigation | efficiency | adopting | a | diversification | strategy | deepening | or | broadening | and | changing | crop | production | These | drought | adaptations | deliberately | incorporate | a | broad | set | of | actions | relating | to | general | farm | management | and | structure | reflecting | the | reality | of | farmer | decision | making | which | incorporates | decisions | on | adaptation | within | broader | often | strategic | risk | management | considerations | Amadou | et | al | 2018

The | adaptations | considered | in | the | model | largely | represent | incremental | adaptations | which | may | result | in | transformational | change | depending | on | their | rate | and | scale | of | implementation | We | adapted | the | definition | of | Vermeulen | et | al | 2018 | and | categorized | adaptations | as | transformational | if | they | resulted | in | an | increase | or | decrease | of | at | least | one | third | of | inputs | within | the | simulated | time | frame | for | irrigation | inputs | or | land | or | a | change | to | the | production | type | which | comprises | two | thirds | of | standard | output | this | ratio | is | set | to | match | the | classification | of | production | types | used | at | initialization | European | Commission | 2017 | Table | 3 | We | additionally | identify | adaptations | which | involve | a | change | in | pursued | strategy | i.e. | goals | as | transformational | In | any | given | year | farmers | pursue | only | one | of | the | four | possible | strategies | This | pursued | strategy | can | change | either | following | the | unprecedented | uptake | of | a | diversification | strategy | or | following | transformational | change | to | inputs | or | scale | which | will | automatically | trigger | the | uptake | of | an | expansive | or | contractive | strategy | depending | on | the | direction | of | change | For | example | transformational | increases | in | the | use | of | irrigation | water | or | farm | size | will | trigger | farmers | to | adopt | an | expansive | strategy | Changes | to | farming | strategies | reflect | the | re | orientation | of | goals | and | establishment | of | new | path | dependencies | following | the | evaluation | of | new | successful | adaptations | by | farmers | Sutherland | et | al | 2012 | If | these | adaptations | no | longer | prove | successful | in | the | future | i.e. | will | result | in | drought | damage | the | farmer | will | be | more | inclined | to | change | strategy | again | and | explore | new | adaptations | see | sub | model | 2 | Farmers | who | chose | to | stop | pursuing | a | diversification | strategy | will | not | cease | their | diversification | activities | but | will | simply | stop | pursuing | future | actions | which | align | specifically | with | the | diversification | strategy

The | ABM | is | structured | around | three | principal | sub | models | Fig | 2 | and | simulates | annual | decision | making | across | an | initial | population | of | 8584 | farmers | throughout | 33 | irrigation | seasons | March | 1st | to | October | 31st | representing | the | years | 2017 | to | 2050 | as | follows | see | SI4 | for | a | comprehensive | description | following | the | Overview | Design | Concepts | Details | and | Decisions | ODD+D | protocol | of | Müller | et | al | 2013

Sub | model | 1 | -demographics | and | soil | wetness | farmers | update | their | age | at | the | beginning | of | each | year | and | upon | retirement | choose | to | pass | their | farm | onto | a | successor | sell | it | to | a | newcomer | farmer | or | place | it | on | sale | on | the | market | At | each | 10 | day | time | step | throughout | the | irrigation | season | precipitation |

maximum | potential | irrigation | volume | available | within | each | LRIC | district | is | distributed | fully | and | equally | throughout | the | season | Irrigation | amounts | are | only | changed | as | a | result | of | 1 | policy | changes | depending | on | the | policy | scenario | Section | 3.4 | 2 | changes | to | irrigation | system | efficiencies | or | 3 | as | a | result | of | critical | drought | periods | determined | by | low | discharge | levels | in | the | Po | River | triggering | the | cessation | of | all | irrigation | withdrawals | At | the | end | of | the | season | farmers | evaluate | whether | fields | have | received | sufficient | water | or | have | experienced | a | deficit | resulting | in | production | damages | and | re | open | any | former | private | water | sources | present | on | damaged | fields | Sub | model | 2 | -adaptation | decision | making | at | the | end | of | the | irrigation | season | farmers | evaluate | whether | to | engage | in | adaptation | by | updating | their | perceptions | of | drought | risk | and | possibilities | for | adaptation | Drought | risk | perception | is | based | on | the | perceived | probability | and | severity | of | drought | occurrence | Grothmann | and | Patt | 2005 | parameterized | by | a | farmer | 's | climate | change | concern | and | whether | their | aspired | agricultural | profits | have | not | been | met | in | the | past | year | following | drought | damage | Older | farmers | without | successors | have | lower | aspired | agricultural | profits | and | act | as | satisficers | rather | than | profit | maximizers | The | two | determinants | of | drought | risk | perception | hold | equal | weight | and | result | in | a | maximum | potential | drought | risk | perception | value | of | 1 | Farmers | with | a | drought | risk | perception | value | of | 0 | do | not | engage | in | any | adaptation | Next | farmers | evaluate | adaptations | by | estimating | each | adaptation | 's | costs | efficacy | and | alignment | with | their | strategy | Grothmann | and | Patt | 2005 | This | is | undertaken | by | calculating | the | expected | utility | of | each | possible | adaptation | by | evaluating | 1 | its | expected | return | on | investment | ROI | i.e. | estimated | annual | profits | divided | by | estimated | investment | costs | normalized | across | all | adaptations | to | hold | a | value | between | 0 | and | 1 | and | 2 | whether | the | adaptation | does | or | does | not | align | with | the | farmer | 's | own | pursued | strategy | respectively | assigning | a | value | of | 0.5 | or | 0 | Table | 3 | Farmers | select | the | adaptation | with | the | highest | utility | yet | will | only | implement | this | adaptation | if | its | utility | value | combined | with | their | drought | risk | perception | value | surpasses | a | threshold | The | threshold | is | lower | equal | to | 2 | for | farmers | who | value | openness | to | change | resulting | in | farmers | with | a | higher | threshold | equal | to | 2.1 | only | engaging | in | adaptation | if | their | drought | risk | perception | is | high | and | if | an | adaptation | both | matches | their | strategy | and | represents | a | high | ROI | Sub | model | 3 | -implementation | of | adaptations | and | feedbacks |

Climate | change | scenarios | provide | baseline | settings | using | the | parameter | values | outlined | in | Section | 3.3 | We | considered | climate | conditions | under | RCPs | 2.6 | 4.5 | and | 8.5 | respectively | representing | low | medium | and | high | greenhouse | gas | emission | scenarios | van | Vuuren | et | al | 2011 | 1 | Within | each | climate | scenario | behavioral | and | water | policy | scenarios | were | independently | explored | i.e. | without | interacting | with | one | another | and | defined | as | follows | details | in | Table | 4

Behavioral | scenarios | the | effect | of | changing | farmer | attitudes | and | values | across | the | population | of | farmers | is | explored | to | scope | the | potential | of | behavioral | changes | alone | in | driving | transformational | adaptations | These | scenarios | termed | most | adaptive | MA | and | least | Behavioral | and | policy | scenarios | are | run | under | low | L | and | high | H | parameter | values | exploring | respective | possibility | spaces | Table | 4 | A | one | factor | at | a | time | sensitivity | analysis | was | additionally | performed | on | each | scenario | parameter | and | run | under | the | most | extreme | conditions | for | each | climate | behavior | and | policy | scenario | group | A | sensitivity | analysis | was | also | run | on | model | parameters | for | which | there | was | greater | uncertainty | i.e. | lacked | more | robust | parameterization | sources | see | SI3 | In | this | case | results | are | reported | for | simulations | run | under | RCP | 2.6 | climate

Changes | to | parameter | values | with | respect | to | baseline | B | conditions | under | the | two | behavior | and | water | policy | scenarios | Behavior | and | water | policy | scenarios | were | explored | independently | i.e. | throughout | separate | model | runs | under | both | low | L | and | high | H | bound | conditions | These | rules | or | values | are | implemented | at | model | initialization

Behavior | 4 | scenario | conditions | alone | ten | Broeke | et | al | 2016 | Schouten | et | al | 2014 | All | results | are | based | on | the | averages | of | 5 | repetitions

All | scenarios | reveal | similar | trends | in | terms | of | which | adaptations | are | preferred | and | implemented | by | farmers | Fig | 3 | Under | all | scenarios | adaptations | relating | to | changing | farm | size | are | the | most | frequently | implemented | on | average | by | 4 | of | farmers | annually | commonly | followed | by | adaptations | involving | irrigation | investments | or | crop | changes | and | lastly | by | adaptations | involving | the | uptake | of | on | farm | income | diversifications | on | average | by | 1 | of | farmers | annually | Scenario | specific | dynamics | however | additionally | emerge

Climate | Under | all | baseline | climate | scenarios | farmers | more | frequently | opt | to | expand | rather | than | reduce | farm | size | Drier | climates | RCP | 2.6 | predictably | increase | the | share | of | adapting | farmers | as | more | farmers | witness | damages | to | production | and | consequently | increase | their | drought | risk | perceptions | and | propensity | to | adapt | Additionally | drier | climates | favor | the | implementation | of | irrigation | investments | over | crop | changes | Behavior | MA | behavior | scenarios | predictably | increase | the | share | of | adapting | farmers | when | compared | to | their | respective | climate | baselines | to | such | an | extent | that | they | show | the | highest | engagement | out | of | all | the | scenarios | The | opposite | dynamic | occurs | under | LA | behavior | scenarios | MA | behavior | scenarios | see | more | frequent | engagement | in | farm | size | increase | than | decrease | in | contrast | to | LA | scenarios | under | high | bound | conditions | which | see | more | frequent | engagement | in | farm | size | contraction | than | expansion | Policy | RD | policy | scenarios | result | in | a | higher | share | of | adapting | farmers | when | compared | to | climate | baselines | particularly | for | adaptations | involving | farm | size | changes | and | irrigation | investments | with | more | farmers | engaging | in | farm | expansion | over | contraction | ES | policy | scenarios | also | result | in | a | higher | share | of | farmers | investing | in | irrigation | than | in | respective | baseline | scenarios | yet | result | in | an | overall | reduction | to | the | total | share | of | adapting | farmers | with | particularly | lower | values | for | farm | expansion

Results | from | the | sensitivity | analysis | SI5 | reveal | that | changes | to | a | farmer | 's | climate | change | concern | influencing | drought | risk | perception | are | primarily | responsible | for | driving | the | results | in | the | behavioral | scenarios | i.e. | the | scenarios | which | result | in | the | greatest | changes | from | baseline | conditions | The | central | role | of | drought | risk | perception | is | also | revealed | in | the | ES | policy | scenario | results | Despite | ES | policy | scenarios | simulating | incentives | for | adaptation | by | subsidizing | irrigation | expansion | the | effect | on | lower | drought | risk | perception | following | more | abundant | water | supplies | results | in | the | overall | less | frequent | engagement | in | adaptation | when | compared | to | baseline | results | Scenarios | which | induce | an | increase | to | drought | risk | perception | i.e. | MA | behavior | RD | policy | and | drier | climates | specifically | result | in | a | greater | share | of | farmers | engaging | in | expansive | adaptations | This | is | due | to | high | drought | risk | perception | encouraging | farmers | to | engage | in | adaptations | outside | of | their | pursued | farming | strategy | therefore | witnessing | a | greater | share | of | farmers | embracing | the | several | adaptations | with | an | expansive | nature | Conversely | scenarios | which | induce | declines | to | drought | risk | perception | i.e. | LA | behavior | and | ES | policy | result | in | more | farmers | implementing | adaptations | aligned | with | their | strategy | and | therefore | fewer | contractive | farmers | adapting | through | farm | expansion

All | scenarios | reveal | a | continuation | of | on | going | processes | of | farm | scale | enlargement | coupled | with | declining | total | agricultural | area | and | number | of | farmers | throughout | the | case | study | region | Farm | scale | enlargement | is | most | pronounced | in | the | MA | behavior | scenario | high | bound | RCP | 2.6 | which | compared | to | other | scenarios | sees | the | smallest | decline | in | regionally | cultivated | area | 28 | and | largest | decline | to | the | number | of | farmers | 67 | Fig | 4c | Widespread | irrigation | expansion | in | MA | scenarios | Fig | 5 | reduces | farm | drought | damages | and | enables | conversions | to | higher | revenue | and | often | more | water | demanding | crops | Consequently | the | MA | H | scenario | under | RCP | 2.6 | is | the | only | scenario | where | total | regional | agricultural | revenues | do | not | witness | a | decline | and | the | share | of | cropland | area | is | subject | to | fewest | drought | damages | Crop | conversions | result | in | net | increases | in | regional | cultivated | area | for | vineyards | cherries | kaki | apple | plums | and | mixed | fruit | orchards | i.e. | crops | with | high | profit | earning | potential | depending | on | a | farmer | 's | conventional | deepening | and/or | irrigated | production | SI5 | Conversions | from | low | revenue | herbaceous | crops | to | higher | revenue | permanent | crops | coupled | with | fewer | sales | of | permanent | crop | fields | result | in | the | regional | share | of | agricultural | area | comprised | of | permanent | crops | increasing | from | 31 | in | the | first | year | of | simulation | to | 51 | in | the | final | years | of | both | RCP | 2.6 | and | 8.5 | simulations | These | trends | involve | considerable | increases | to | irrigation | withdrawals | which | are | on | average | largest | in | MA | behavior | scenarios | than | in | other | scenario | explorations

RD | policy | scenarios | have | considerably | different | impacts | on | Romagna | 's | agricultural | sector | than | MA | scenarios | despite | similarly | promoting | adaptation | In | RD | H | scenarios | only | vineyards | witness | a | net | increase | in | area | as | changes | to | high | water | demanding | crops | are | restricted | SI5 | Despite | larger | increases | to | irrigated | area | than | in | ES | policy | and | baseline | scenarios | RD | scenarios | witness | fewer | irrigation | withdrawals | SI5 | and | therefore | only | hold | a | small | potential | to | mitigate | drought | damages | when | compared | to | baseline | scenarios | Fig | 5 | On | average | RD | policy | scenarios | see | stronger | declines | to | total | regional | agricultural | revenues | than | baseline | scenarios | yet | these | remain | higher | than | under | ES | policy | or | LA | behavior | scenarios | Fig | 4c

The | lower | frequency | of | expansive | adaptation | under | ES | policy | and | LA | behavior | scenarios | results | in | larger | losses | to | regional | cultivated | area | fewer | losses | to | the | number | of | farmers | and | less | pronounced | farm | enlargement | processes | than | in | RD | or | MA | scenarios | Among | all | scenarios | the | largest | declines | in | regional | cultivated | area | are | seen | in | ES | policy | scenarios | average | of | 39 | while | the | smallest | declines | to | the | number | of | farmers | are | seen | in | LA | behavior | scenarios | average | of | 50 | Fig | 4c | Regional | agricultural | revenues | remain | worst | impacted | by | LA | behavior | scenarios | representing | the | only | scenario | where | irrigation | withdrawals | decline | and | where | the | fewest | crop | conversions | occur | resulting | in | average | total | crop | revenue | declines | of | 26 | especially | affecting | grains | high | water | demanding | vegetables | and | olives | SI5 | As | a | result | of | higher | irrigation | expansion | in | ES | policy | scenarios | than | in | LA | behavior | scenarios | drought | induced | damages | to | production | are | more | effectively | mitigated | and | regional | agricultural | revenues | see | smaller | declines | Fig | 5 | Compared | with | baseline | conditions | however | ES | policy | scenarios | see | stronger | declines | to | regional | agricultural | revenues | despite | a | smaller | share | of | cropland | witnessing | drought | damage | SI5

Fig | 4a | illustrates | the | mean | annual | share | of | farmers | undergoing | different | types | of | transformational | adaptation | in | each | scenario | illustrating | the | frequency | with | which | major | change | to | the | use | of | inputs | scale | production | or | pursued | farming | strategy | occurs | Averaged | results | from | all | simulated | scenarios | reveal | that | while | approximately | 14 | of | farmers | engage | in | adaptation | annually | 8 | of | farmers | implement | adaptations | which | are | considered | transformational | SI5 | most | frequently | involving | a | strategy | change | or | major | increases | to | inputs | or | scale | All | farmers | which | adapt | by | starting | new | diversification | activities | inherently | undergo | a | transformational | adaptation | On | average | 44 | of | annual | adaptations | through | land | purchases | represent | transformational | cases | a | value | which | increases | to | 57 | when | considering | land | sales

Approximately | 2 | of | farmers | engage | in | crop | change | irrigation | system | efficiency | improvements | or | irrigation | expansion | annually | while | transformational | changes | relating | to | production | type | change | input | increases | or | input | decreases | similarly | lie | in | the | range | of | 1 | 2 | Figs | 3 | 4

These | results | suggest | the | different | types | of | transformational | adaptation | represent | a | considerable | share | and | in | some | cases | majority | of | adaptations | undertaken | throughout | simulations | As | farmers | engage | in | transformational | changes | to | farm | size | or | input | use | they | will | also | change | their | pursued | strategy | towards | an | expansive | following | resource | increases | or | contractive | strategy | following | resource | reductions | This | establishes | new | path | dependencies | acting | as | positive | re | enforcements | which | exacerbate | regional | farm | scale | enlargement | and | further | encourage | farmers | to | pursue | expansive | adaptations | by | purchasing | land | from | contractive | farmers | gradually | moving | towards | farm | exit | Contractive | farmers | represent | the | least | pursued | strategy | by | the | end | of | all | scenario | explorations | while | the | share | of | farmers | pursuing | expansive | strategies | increases | from | 32 | to | an | average | of | 52 | SI5 | Transformations | relating | to | crop | changes | although | less | frequent | than | those | relating | to | scale | further | contribute | to | scale | enlargement | trends | as | these | involve | transitions | towards | more | input | intensive | permanent | crops | thereby | also | promoting | the | adoption | of | an | expansive | strategy | Active | farms | therefore | become | on | average | larger | and | more | profitable | throughout | simulations | Additionally | transformational | changes | in | strategy | also | relate | to | the | uptake | of | diversification | strategies | which | gain | 4 | with | red | bars | illustrating | results | under | the | higher | bound | scenario | values | Scenario | H | Table | 4 | Tabulated | results | are | illustrated | in | SI5 | All | farmers | pursue | only | one | strategy | in | any | given | year | yet | diversifying | farmers | will | maintain | their | diversification | activities | even | if | they | chose | to | pursue | a | non | diversifying | strategy | In | this | case | a | farmer | is | implementing | two | strategies | despite | only | actively | pursuing | one | For | interpretation | of | the | references | to | colour | in | this | figure | legend | the | reader | is | referred | to | the | web | version | of | this | article

prominence | with | respect | to | baseline | conditions | in | all | scenarios

Transformational | trends | mirror | adaptation | results | and | therefore | also | hold | different | implications | across | scenarios | Results | from | the | RD | policy | scenarios | show | more | frequent | transformations | than | in | baseline | conditions | particularly | relating | to | major | increases | in | farm | size | and | input | use | Fig | 4a | therefore | partly | compromising | the | policy | goal | to | reduce | irrigation | SI5 | On | the | other | hand | results | from | the | ES | policy | scenarios | show | a | reduction | in | transformational | adaptations | when | compared | to | baseline | conditions | for | all | transformational | changes | except | those | relating | to | scale | decline | and | input | changes | Under | ES | policy | conditions | these | transformational | changes | result | in | fewer | farmers | changing | strategy | to | actively | pursue | diversification | or | expansive | strategies | and | more | farmers | changing | strategy | to | actively | pursue | a | contractive | strategy | SI5

Our | scenario | results | are | largely | in | line | with | historical | trends | SI5 | Ongoing | regional | processes | of | agricultural | area | decline | farm | scale | enlargement | and | increased | prevalence | of | permanent | crops | will | continue | under | all | climate | change | scenarios | regardless | of | behavioral | changes | by | farmers | or | the | implementation | of | water | policies | Both | behavior | and | policy | change | can | however | play | a | significant | role | in | either | stimulating | or | reducing | the | need | for | farmers | to | undertake | different | transformational | adaptations | with | important | repercussions | to | farm | structure | and | regional | variables | These | repercussions | are | best | analyzed | by | acknowledging | the | ways | in | which | policy | and | behavior | influence | different | components | of | drought | vulnerability | MA | behavior | and | RD | policy | interventions | increase | the | adaptive | capacity | of | farms | seeing | a | smaller | and | more | dynamic | future | farmer | population | with | higher | reliance | on | irrigated | permanent | crops | diversification | activities | and | expansive | strategies | On | the | other | hand | ES | water | policies | solely | reduce | the | sensitivity | of | farms | to | drought | risk | without | incentivizing | broader | transformational | change

Adaptation | planning | currently | focuses | on | achieving | benchmarks | of | adaptation | success | which | are | often | ill | defined | Dilling | et | al | 2019 | have | recently | proposed | that | adaptation | planning | may | therefore | be | better | targeted | at | increasing | and | measuring | the | adaptive | capacity | of | individuals | and | institutions | to | a | broad | range | of | risks | This | notion | suggests | greater | potential | may | be | found | within | initiatives | promoting | MA | behavior | and | RD | policies | where | more | widespread | openness | to | change | and | drought | risk | perception | among | farmers | result | in | the | largest | share | of | engagement | in | different | transformational | adaptations | This | dynamic | highlights | the | importance | of | potential | linkages | between | policy | and | norm | formation | requiring | an | examination | of | the | potential | of | behaviorfocused | interventions | targeting | attitudinal | and | value | change | Gifford | et | al | 2011 | An | example | of | such | an | intervention | is | illustrated | by | the | RD | policy | scenarios | where | climate | risk | communication | strongly | promotes | engagement | in | adaptation | A | more | in | depth | modelling | exploration | of | the | impacts | of | such | informational | strategies | and | other | behavior | focused | interventions | including | penalties | or | rewards | based | approaches | Steg | and | Vlek | 2009 | alongside | informal | risk | communication | dynamics | Kandiah | et | al | 2017 | are | therefore | priority | areas | for | further | research | Our | modelling | results | revealed | that | structural | policy | interventions | e.g. | production | regulations | and | irrigation | subsidies | have | a | more | limited | influence | on | increasing | a | farmer | 's | adaptive | capacity | in | comparison | to | behavioral | approaches | Further | research | is | needed | in | order | to | assert | whether | other | structural | variables | could | act | as | enablers | for | increased | adaptive | capacity | for | example | by | further | supporting | diversifications | or | collective | approaches | with | the | potential | to | stimulate | learning | Bouttes | et | al | 2019

By | simulating | feedbacks | between | implemented | adaptations | and | farmer | assets | goals | and | irrigation | consumption | our | model | enables | the | identification | of | trade | offs | and | can | therefore | inform | the | adaptation | planning | process | Notably | MA | behavior | and | RD | policy | scenarios | showed | that | higher | rates | of | transformational | adaptation | result | in | larger | and | partly | more | profitable | production | than | under | baseline | conditions | yet | see | marked | declines | to | the | total | number | of | farms | This | dynamic | is | largely | reversed | under | ES | policy | and | LA | behavior | scenarios | Other | tradeoffs | present | potential | cases | of | maladaptation | i.e. | situations | where | implemented | adaptations | result | in | increases | to | vulnerability | and | vulnerability | transfers | Barreteau | et | al | 2020 | Juhola | et | al | 2016 | Trade | offs | between | agricultural | production | and | water | conservation | under | RD | policy | scenarios | see | irrigation | quota | reductions | effectively | reduce | irrigation | withdrawals | but | predictably | increase | drought | risk | exposure | to | irrigated | farmers | which | coupled | with | restricted | crop | conversions | ultimately | results | in | a | decline | to | regional | agricultural | revenues | when | compared | to | baseline | conditions | MA | behavior | reduces | drought | exposure | because | of | frequent | adaptation | and | irrigation | investments | yet | subsequent | transitions | to | high | water | demanding | crops | may | be | placing | these | farmers | at | higher | risk | of | drought | damage | in | the | future | The | ES | policy | scenarios | also | show | a | potential | risk | of | maladaptation | due | to | declining | drought | risk | perceptions | and | lower | engagement | in | expansive | adaptation | despite | incentivized | irrigation | investments | leaving | the | smallest | cultivated | area | under | production | and | substantial | declines | to | regional | agricultural | revenues

Transformational | adaptations | represent | a | substantial | share | of | undertaken | adaptations | in | all | scenarios | This | finding | implies | substantial | social | and | financial | costs | will | be | experienced | by | farmers | calling | for | an | exploration | of | the | ways | in | which | institutions | may | compensate | for | such | costs | and | for | a | more | thorough | investigation | of | potential | social | limits | to | adaptation | Adger | et | al | 2009 | Frequent | transformational | changes | in | pursued | farming | strategy | resulted | in | new | path | dependencies | which | strongly | promoted | the | continued | implementation | of | expansive | practices | This | was | most | evident | in | the | MA | behavior | scenarios | where | transitions | to | expansionist | strategies | resulted | in | greater | reductions | to | drought | damage | and | increases | to | irrigation | than | in | scenarios | where | water | policies | were | explicitly | designed | to | target | these | respective | objectives | A | unified | integrated | drought | risk | management | policy | may | therefore | aim | to | draw | on | the | benefits | of | combining | initiatives | stimulating | drought | risk | perception | and | therefore | generic | adaptation | behavior | with | targeted | irrigation | regulations | or | incentives | Eakin | et | al | 2014 | It | must | also | establish | whether | and | how | to | prioritize | water | conservation | to | avoid | the | introduction | of | contrasting | measures | which | both | incentivize | irrigation | expansion | e.g. | by | increasing | drought | risk | perceptions | through | awareness | campaigns | and | reduced | consumption | e.g. | through | subsidized | water | use | efficiency | Stein | et | al | 2016

Trade | offs | between | socio | economic | and | environmental | sustainability | under | water | and | agricultural | policy | scenarios | in | Emilia | Romagna | were | also | identified | by | Bartolini | et | al | 2007 | and | Bozzola | and | Swanson | 2014 | Similarly | they | find | that | water | resource | abundance | can | limit | the | number | of | farmers | engaging | in | adaptation | and | call | for | a | common | policy | design | framework | to | facilitate | the | uptake | of | farm | adaptations | Policy | recommendations | for | the | more | deliberate | management | of | transformational | adaptations | are | furthermore | listed | by | Vermeulen | et | al | 2018 | and | include | a | need | to | reward | farmers | for | the | provision | of | multiple | services | to | provide | financial | compensation | mechanisms | if | necessary | transformational | adaptations | result | in | significant | short | term | losses | and | to | present | tools | that | can | monitor | and | identify | trade | offs | from | the | implementation | of | transformational | changes

Our | model | distinguishes | itself | from | past | work | primarily | through | the | representation | of | farm | level | adaptation | decision | making | as | a | process | embedded | within | a | farmer | 's | wider | strategic | planning | therefore | involving | the | consideration | of | both | transformational | and | incremental | adaptations | The | integration | of | this | perspective | within | an | ABM | environment | allowed | for | the | quantification | of | the | occurrence | and | scale | of | transformational | change | as | well | as | the | consideration | of | feedbacks | between | transformational | changes | and | a | farmer | 's | strategic | goals | Different | conceptualizations | of | transformational | adaptation | from | the | one | implemented | in | our | model | however | exist | According | to | Kates | et | al | 2012 | transformational | adaptations | are | additionally | identified | within | actions | that | are | entirely | new | to | a | region | or | system | or | within | actions | involving | a | shift | in | location | Under | these | definitions | our | modelled | adaptations | would | therefore | not | be | identified | as | transformational | as | they | primarily | illustrate | a | continuation | of | historical | trends | The | absence | of | such | novel | findings | is | a | direct | reflection | of | both | our | choice | of | scenarios | and | of | simulated | social | processes | We | deliberately | explored | water | policy | scenarios | which | reflect | presently | occurring | discourses | in | the | regionyet | these | discourses | largely | envisage | a | continuation | of | existing | policy | mechanisms | e.g. | expansion | of | subsidization | schemes | For | the | behavioral | scenarios | we | focused | on | exploring | the | influence | of | different | value | and | attitude | prevalence | without | simulating | potential | feedbacks | to | broader | organizational | change | In | the | absence | of | deliberately | novel | and | transformational | policy | e.g. | provision | of | off | farm | employment | Du | et | al | 2016 | bottom | up | collective | action | e.g. | new | farmer | associations | Osbahr | et | al | 2008 | or | private | initiatives | e.g. | relocation | of | production | sites | Marshall | et | al | 2013 | our | results | therefore | demonstrate | future | adaptations | are | likely | to | be | transformative | largely | only | in | terms | of | their | magnitude | Further | work | is | needed | to | operationalize | different | dimensions | of | transformational | adaptation | and | shed | light | on | their | respective | drivers | and | implications

The | model | addressed | some | of | the | shortcomings | of | climate | adaptation | models | identified | in | the | reviews | of | Brown | et | al | 2017 | and | Holman | et | al | 2018 | Unlike | many | models | we | did | not | assume | adaptations | as | consistent | effective | or | objective | we | captured | both | triggers | and | constraints | to | adaptation | dynamically | represented | climate | and | explicitly | represented | the | decision | making | process | The | use | of | ABM | further | enabled | the | more | fundamental | representation | of | heterogeneous | farm | level | characteristics | and | therefore | adaptation | responses | Reidsma | et | al | 2010 | Stringer | et | al | 2020 | We | also | sought | to | implement | the | model | at | a | scale | consistent | with | regional | adaptation | planning | covering | the | territorial | extent | of | two | local | LRIC | Despite | the | context | specific | nature | of | the | model | we | characterized | the | farmer | population | according | to | European | wide | classifications | production | type | and | farming | strategy | and | drew | on | established | theories | of | value | and | decision | making | behavior | therefore | presenting | opportunities | for | eventual | comparison | across | European | contexts

Some | pitfalls | attributed | to | agent | based | adaptation | modelling | and | lack | of | data | for | parameterization | however | remain | We | used | singular | proxy | actions | to | represent | two | separate | diversification | strategies | further | effort | could | be | placed | on | improving | their | representation | for | example | by | simulating | adaptive | changes | within | the | diversification | trajectories | themselves | as | well | as | processes | of | withdrawal | Despite | integration | of | social | and | biophysical | processes | oversimplifications | were | made | and | important | processes | omitted | With | regards | to | biophysical | processes | the | ABM | lacks | an | important | feedback | between | irrigation | expansion | and | declining | irrigation | availability | as | limits | to | freshwater | resources | in | the | region | could | not | be | identified | The | integration | of | this | feedback | will | undoubtedly | influence | possibilities | for | irrigation | expansion | in | our | model | especially | affecting | results | from | the | MA | behavior | scenarios | Additionally | while | our | model | sought | to | simulate | adaptations | to | water | scarcity | interviewed | farmers | also | expressed | concern | at | the | increased | frequency | of | cloudburst | and | hail | events | Greater | emphasis | on | multihazard | responses | and | the | evaluation | of | mitigation | action | alongside | adaptation | should | be | addressed | in | future | models | Our | representation | of | cumulative | soil | wetness | disregarded | climatic | effects | throughout | the | months | of | November | and | December | and | assumed | a | soil | wetness | value | of | 0 | with | the | beginning | of | each | calendar | year | likely | resulting | in | some | divergence | between | our | simulated | drought | projections | in | comparison | to | other | regional | models | Basso | et | al | 2015 | While | this | representation | can | provide | insight | on | how | farm | level | transformational | adaptations | respond | to | climate | change | more | accurate | predictions | of | responses | to | projected | climate | change | will | therefore | require | the | integration | of | detailed | crop | growth | models | Improved | representation | of | crop | and | water | expansion | suitability | should | also | be | addressed | to | increase | reliability | of | results | as | the | sensitivity | analysis | revealed | the | proxy | neighborhood | radius | as | particularly | influential | to | modelling | outcomes | SI5

In | addition | to | the | need | to | improve | the | representation | of | policy | impacts | on | farmer | values | and | attitudes | in | further | research | similar | efforts | should | be | placed | on | the | representation | of | feedbacks | from | changing | farmer | behavior | to | institutional | change | The | inclusion | of | institutions | as | responsive | rather | than | external | entities | in | a | land | use | change | ABM | has | recently | been | explored | by | Holzhauer | et | al | 2019 | who | call | for | empirical | analyses | of | institutional | decision | making | to | facilitate | the | integration | of | such | processes | within | socio | ecological | modelling | In | the | context | of | water | management | Valkering | et | al | 2009 | have | drawn | on | literature | on | sociotechnical | transitions | and | used | participatory | ABM | to | illustrate | how | water | policy | may | develop | following | environmental | change | policy | oriented | learning | coalition | forming | and | changing | public | support | and | water | cultures | Such | approaches | involve | the | representation | of | co | evolving | individual | and | institutional | behaviors | and | therefore | also | of | decisionmaking | processes | of | policy | makers | further | illustrating | how | institutions | may | guide | the | deliberate | implementation | of | transformational | change | Wilson | et | al | 2020

This | study | investigated | the | multi | level | processes | of | transformational | adaptation | to | water | scarcity | among | crop | farming | systems | in | Romagna | through | the | development | of | an | empirical | agent | based | model | Our | simulations | revealed | that | scenarios | which | induce | increases | to | farmer | drought | risk | perceptions | have | the | greatest | potential | to | increase | the | implementation | of | transformational | adaptations | and | promote | expansive | adaptations | These | trends | primarily | occur | in | scenarios | simulating | drier | climates | most | adaptive | farming | behaviors | and | water | policies | aiming | at | regulating | irrigation | consumption | and | result | in | a | region | with | fewest | reductions | in | cultivated | area | increased | irrigation | and | fewest | highest | profit | earning | farmers | largely | exacerbating | presently | occurring | trends | Policies | aiming | to | ensure | irrigation | water | supply | successfully | reduce | the | share | of | cultivated | area | witnessing | drought | related | damages | to | production | yet | by | aiming | solely | to | reduce | drought | sensitivity | they | primarily | result | in | declining | drought | risk | perceptions | and | therefore | see | fewer | transformational | adaptations | and | relatively | more | farmers | implementing | contractive | adaptations

Our | results | reveal | the | importance | of | quantifying | the | occurrence | and | scope | of | transformational | adaptations | in | the | modelling | of | farm | system | adaptations | Transformations | represent | more | than | half | of | annual | implemented | adaptations | on | average | throughout | the | simulations | and | in | scenarios | where | more | transformations | occur | frequently | involve | farmers | changing | their | goals | and | adopting | an | expansionist | strategy | This | transformation | induces | new | path | dependencies | acting | as | positive | reenforcements | which | lead | farmers | to | repeatedly | engage | in | expansionist | adaptations | with | implications | for | water | policy | Policies | aiming | to | regulate | irrigation | demand | promote | greater | awareness | of | drought | risk | and | therefore | encourage | farmers | to | purse | expansive | strategies | and | invest | in | new | irrigation | sources | partly | off | setting | reductions | to | irrigation | withdrawals | promoted | by | crop | regulations | and | subsidized | efficiency | investments | Policies | aiming | to | ensure | irrigation | supply | successfully | reduce | drought | damages | and | retain | a | higher | number | of | farmers | yet | by | disfavoring | transformations | and | promoting | contractive | adaptations | they | result | in | the | most | significant | declines | to | agricultural | area | and | therefore | regional | revenues | An | integrated | drought | risk | management | policy | may | therefore | aim | to | draw | on | the | benefits | of | either | approach | combining | a | need | for | increased | generic | adaptation | capacity | with | targeted | incentives | and | regulations | required | for | addressing | sector | specific | goals | As | agricultural | system | models | move | towards | greater | representation | of | farm | level | heterogeneity | decision | making | and | adaptation | processes | we | highlight | the | importance | of | explicitly | accounting | for | transformational | change | and | see | potential | in | further | investigating | this | concept | through | further | operationalization | of | its | different | dimensions | alongside | exploration | of | institutional | decision | making | and | closer | representation | of | value | and | norm | formation
