This | paper | presents | the | first | EU | wide | individual | farm | level | model | IFM | CAP | -Individual | Farm | Model | for | CAP | Analysis | to | assess | the | impacts | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | introduced | by | the | 2013 | CAP | reform | as | part | of | CAP | greening | Based | on | Positive | Mathematical | Programming | IFM | CAP | simulates | the | behaviour | of | each | individual | farmer | in | the | EU | FADN | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | database | under | the | policy | constraint | of | crop | diversification | and | provides | distributional | impacts | over | the | entire | EU | farm | population | Simulation | results | show | that | the | effects | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | on | the | EU | farming | sector | are | rather | small | At | the | aggregate | EU | level | the | proportion | of | the | reallocated | area | due | to | the | diversification | measure | represents | less | than | 1 | of | the | total | agricultural | area | and | the | crop | production | and | income | decline | by | less | than | 0.5 | At | the | individual | farm | level | the | impacts | could | be | more | pronounced | more | than | -25 | although | the | number | of | affected | farms | by | the | measure | remains | small | around | 5 | of | the | total | farm | population | The | most | constraining | component | of | the | diversification | measure | appears | to | be | the | 75 | threshold | imposed | for | the | main | cultivated | crop

The | Common | Agricultural | Policy | CAP | was | reformed | in | 2013 | with | the | aim | to | enhance | the | environmental | performance | of | the | EU | agricultural | sector | The | key | change | introduced | by | the | reform | was | to | create | a | stronger | linkage | of | the | direct | payments | to | agricultural | practices | beneficial | to | the | climate | and | environment | so | called | CAP | greening | The | CAP | greening | includes | three | measures | that | are | obligatory | for | farmers | who | wish | to | receive | the | full | direct | payment | crop | diversification | the | maintenance | of | permanent | pasture | and | the | respect | of | ecological | focus | areas | EU | 2013

In | this | paper | we | attempt | to | quantify | the | impact | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | on | land | use | production | and | income | of | EU | farm | sector | The | crop | diversification | measure | targets | land | allocation | at | farm | level | with | the | aim | to | generate | environmental | public | goods | to | the | society | The | eligibility | and | uptake | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | largely | depends | on | farm | specific | characteristics | size | cropping | pattern | etc | posing | challenges | for | policy | evaluation | and | raising | the | need | for | the | application | of | farm | level | modelling | tools | In | fact | most | of | the | currently | applied | models | at | EU | wide | scale | are | aggregate | models | representative | farm | regions | countries | groups | of | countries | and | are | not | fully | able | to | model | policies | targeted | at | farm | level | without | imposing | strong | ad | hoc | assumptions | Lansink | and | Peerlings | 1996 | Gocht | and | Britz | 2011 | Cantelaube | et | al | 2012 | Louhichi | et | al | 2013 | Farmspecific | policies | can | be | better | assessed | using | models | that | operate | at | the | level | of | individual | farms | and | that | are | able | to | account | for | farm | heterogeneity | in | terms | of | policy | representation | and | impacts | The | more | local | and | farm | specific | the | interventions | are | the | more | the | modelling | at | the | individual | farm | level | becomes | important | Buysse | et | al | 2007

Although | several | modelling | approaches | have | been | used | in | the | literature | 1 | mathematical | programming | is | the | most | frequently | used | method | for | modelling | policies | at | the | farm | level | in | ex | ante | evaluations | Most | of | these | farm | level | models | are | based | either | on | individual | real | farms | e.g. | Buysse | et | al | 2007 | Solazzo | and | Pierangeli | 2016 | or | on | representative | average | farms | e.g. | Gocht | and | Britz | 2011 | Louhichi | et | al | 2010 | Although | representative | farm | models | can | assess | to | some | extent | the | farm | specific | policies | such | as | CAP | greening | they | are | subject | to | some | limitations | They | can | not | model | policies | for | which | eligibility | depends | on | individual | farm | characteristics | and | location | as | is | the | case | for | the | crop | diversification | policy | as | they | are | subject | to | significant | aggregation | bias | In | the | case | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | certain | farms | have | to | produce | a | minimum | of | two | crops | with | the | main | crop | representing | maximum | 75 | of | arable | area | By | construction | the | cropping | pattern | is | much | more | diversified | for | a | representative | farm | than | it | is | for | the | actual | individual | farms | on | the | basis | of | which | the | representative | farm | was | created | As | a | result | the | crop | diversification | requirements | will | usually | be | respected | not | binding | at | the | level | of | the | representative | farm | although | the | restriction | may | be | binding | at | the | level | of | individual | farms | In | contrast | the | other | two | greening | measuresmaintenance | of | permanent | pasture | and | the | ecological | focus | areacan | be | modelled | with | representative | average | farms | models | by | imposing | less | restrictive | assumptions | even | though | aggregation | bias | can | not | be | fully | eliminated | Similar | types | of | policies | available | within | the | past | CAP | e.g. | set | aside | grassland | regulation | within | cross | compliance | requirements | were | extensively | modelled | with | aggregated | models | at | regional | or | representative | farm | level | e.g. | Kupker | et | al | 2006 | Philippidis | et | al | 2006 | Schuler | and | Sattler | 2010

Another | drawback | of | existing | farm | models | is | that | most | of | them | are | developed | for | a | specific | purpose | and/or | location | and | consequently | can | not | easily | be | adapted | and | reused | for | other | applications | and | contexts | Louhichi | et | al | 2010 | Out | of | a | large | number | of | EU | based | representative | farm | models | only | two | have | full | EU | coverage | CAPRI | FT | Gocht | and | Britz | 2011 | and | AROPAj | De | Cara | and | Jayet | 2011 | The | other | models | cover | either | a | specific | Member | State | MS | e.g. | FAMOS | Schmid | 2004 | or | a | selected | set | of | MSs | regions | e.g. | FARMIS | by | Offermann | et | al | 2005 | Depperman | et | al | 2013 | 2016 | FSSIM | by | Louhichi | et | al | 2010 | AGRIPOLIS | by | Kellermann | et | al | 2008 | or | a | specific | policy | issue | e.g. | farm | level | investment | behaviour | under | different | policy | settings | in | Viaggi | et | al | 2010 | Raggi | et | al | 2015 | To | our | knowledge | there | are | no | individual | real | farm | level | models | with | a | full | EU | coverage | available | in | the | literature | Probably | the | main | reasons | for | this | gap | relate | to | the | computational | difficulty | in | solving | an | individual | farm | level | model | with | a | large | spatial | coverage | such | as | EU | as | well | as | these | types | of | models | being | very | demanding | in | data | which | might | not | be | available | or | easily | accessible | parameterization | and | calibration | compared | to | farm | representative | models

With | respect | to | modelling | the | impact | of | CAP | greening | measures | there | is | a | growing | literature | investigating | their | socio | economic | impacts | e.g. | Heinrich | 2012 | Czekaj | et | al | 2013 | Mahy | et | al | 2015 | Ahmadi | et | al | 2015 | While | a | number | of | studies | have | opened | the | debate | on | the | effectiveness | of | greening | measures | Matthews | 2012 | Westhoek | et | al | 2013 | Singh | et | al | 2014 | the | few | available | farm | level | studies | contribute | only | partially | to | the | ongoing | debate | because | they | are | applied | only | for | specific | agricultural | sectors | and/or | selected | countries | or | regions | Heinrich | 2012 | Brown | and | Jones | 2013 | Vanni | and | Cardillo | 2013 | Solazzo | et | al | 2014 | Was | et | al | 2014 | Cimino | et | al | 2015 | Mahy | et | al | 2015 | Cortignani | and | Dono | 2015 | Galán | Martín | et | al | 2015 | Other | farm | level | studies | deal | with | other | CAP | measures | such | as | decoupled | payments | Fragoso | et | al | 2011 | Moro | and | Sckokai | 2013 | Karlsson | and | Nilsson | 2014 | the | young | farmers | scheme | Bournaris | et | al | 2014 | or | the | impact | of | CAP | on | natural | resource | management | Gibbons | et | al | 2005 | Cortignani | and | Severini | 2009 | None | of | these | models | allows | for | a | comprehensive | EU | wide | analysis | of | CAP | greening | measures | at | farm | level

This | paper | attempts | to | contribute | to | the | literature | by | providing | the | assessment | of | farm | level | impacts | of | crop | diversification | measure | using | an | EU | wide | individual | farm | level | model | IFM | CAP | Individual | Farm | Model | for | Common | Agricultural | Policy | Analysis | The | main | advantage | of | IFM | CAP | is | that | it | provides | a | comprehensive | assessment | of | farmspecific | policies | such | as | crop | diversification | measure | by | accounting | for | the | full | heterogeneity | and | behaviour | of | EU | commercial | farms | 2 | in | terms | of | policy | representation | and | impacts | and | by | estimating | the | distributional | impacts | of | policies | across | the | farm | population | The | model | is | developed | based | on | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | FADN | and | complemented | by | external | statistical | sources

The | paper | is | structured | as | follows | Section | 2 | describes | the | IFM | CAP | model | structure | calibration | process | and | data | processing | Section | 3 | presents | the | baseline | and | the | crop | diversification | scenarios | simulated | in | this | paper | Section | 4 | describes | the | results | of | the | model | application | for | the | crop | diversification | measure | Section | 5 | provides | a | short | discussion | of | the | results | and | explains | the | limitations | of | the | model | Finally | Section | 6 | draws | the | main | conclusions | and | policy | implications

The | IFM | CAP | model | is | a | static | Positive | Mathematical | Programming | PMP | model | which | builds | on | the | FADN | data | and | is | complemented | by | other | relevant | EU | wide | data | sources | such | as | the | Farm | Structure | Survey | FSS | Eurostat | CAPRI | Common | Agricultural | Policy | Regional | Impact | Analysis | database | Britz | and | Witzke | 2014 | and | other | sources | In | order | to | reach | the | best | representativeness | and | to | capture | the | full | heterogeneity | of | the | EU | farm | population | the | whole | FADN | farm | constant | sample | between | 2007 | and | 2009 | around | 60,500 | farms | is | individually | modelled

IFM | CAP | relies | on | profit | maximizing | behaviour | and | attempts | to | find | the | optimal | land | allocation | among | production | activities | taking | into | account | resource | arable | and | grass | land | and | animal | feeding | and | policy | constraints | such | as | sales | quotas | and | set | aside | obligations | Land | constraints | are | used | to | match | the | available | land | that | can | be | used | in | a | production | operation | and | the | possible | use | by | the | different | agricultural | activities | Constraints | related | to | feed | availability | and | feed | requirements | of | animal | activities | are | used | to | ensure | that | the | total | energy | protein | and | fibre | requirements | are | met | by | farm | grown | or | and | purchased | feed

Farm | profit | is | defined | as | the | sum | of | gross | margins | minus | a | nonlinear | quadratic | activity | specific | function | The | gross | margin | is | equal | to | the | total | revenue | including | sales | from | agricultural | products | and | compensation | payments | coupled | and | decoupled | payments | minus | the | accounting | variable | costs | of | production | activities | The | accounting | costs | include | costs | of | seeds | fertilisers | crop | protection | feeding | and | other | specific | costs | Fig | 1 | The | quadratic | activity | specific | function | is | a | behavioural | function | introduced | to | calibrate | the | farm | model | to | an | observed | base | year | situation | 3 | as | is | usually | done | in | positive | programming | models | This | function | intends | to | capture | any | type | of | model | misspecification | such | as | aggregation | bias | price | expectation | and | lacking | representation | of | risk | behaviour | capital | and | labour | perceived | costs | and | other | non | observed | non | linear | constraints | Heckelei | 2002 | de | Frahan | et | al | 2007

An | identical | model | structure | was | applied | for | all | modelled | FADN | farms | in | order | to | ensure | a | uniform | handling | of | all | the | individual | farm | models | and | their | results | i.e. | farm | models | have | the | same | equations | and | variables | but | the | model | parameters | are | farm | specific | There | are | no | cross | farm | constraints | or | relationships | assumed | in | the | current | version | of | the | model

The | general | mathematical | formulation | of | the | profit | maximization | problem | of | farm | f | 1 | 2 | F | is | as | follows

where | indices | i | i′ | 1 | 2 | I | denote | the | crop | and | livestock | activities | and | products | 4 | k | 1 | 2 | K | the | intermediate | inputs | i.e. | fertiliser | seeds | crop | protection | etc | and | m | 1 | 2 | M | the | resource | and | policy | constraints | e.g. | agricultural | land | quotas | set | aside | animal | feeding | π | f | is | the | objective | function | value | of | farm | f | x | f | i | is | the | non | negative | level | i.e. | hectares | heads | of | activity | i | p | f | i | denotes | product | prices | including | for | feed | and | young | animals | y | f | i | are | yields | s | f | i | are | coupled | payments | e | f | are | decoupled | payments | t | f | is | eligible | area | for | decoupled | payments | 5

C | f | i | k | are | accounting | variable | costs | for | intermediate | input | k | and | activity | i | d | f | i | is | the | linear | term | of | the | behavioural | activity | function | and | Q | f | i | i | is | the | quadratic | term | of | the | behavioural | activity | function | A | f | i | m | are | coefficients | for | resource | and | policy | constraints | i.e. | land | set | aside | obligations | quotas | and | animal | feeding | b | f | m | are | available | resource | levels | and | upper | bounds | to | the | policy | constraints | and | ρ | f | m | are | their | corresponding | shadow | prices | 6 | It | is | important | to | note | that | the | removal | of | the | accounting | variable | costs | from | the | quadratic | behavioural | function | by | introducing | a | Leontief | production | function | for | variable | input | costs | presents | some | advantages | i | it | provides | an | explicit | link | between | production | activities | and | the | total | physical | input | use | ii | it | eases | the | linkage | to | environmental | indicator | calculation | and | iii | it | allows | the | simulation | of | policy | measures | linked | to | specific | farm | management | Its | main | limitation | according | to | Heckelei | and | Wolff | 2003 | is | the | lack | of | rationalization | as | intermediate | input | uses | are | assumed | to | be | independent | of | the | unknown | marginal | costs | captured | by | the | quadratic | behavioural | function

Over | the | last | decade | several | PMP | approaches | have | been | developed | to | derive | the | parameters | of | the | behavioural | functions | d | f | i | and | Q | f | i | i | and | to | accurately | calibrate | programming | models | 7 | However | as | the | number | of | observations | is | usually | not | sufficient | to | allow | for | the | traditional | econometric | estimation | an | ill | posed | problem | most | of | the | proposed | approaches | go | without | any | type | of | estimation | by | setting | all | off | diagonal | elements | of | Q | f | i | i′ | to | zero | and | calculating | the | remaining | parameters | using | ad | hoc | assumptions | In | order | to | reduce | the | arbitrary | parameter | specifications | and | estimate | more | reliable | behavioural | functions | covering | all | the | parameters | the | more | recent | applied | programming | models | have | either | i | used | exogenous | information | on | supply | elasticities | Britz | and | Witzke | 2014 | Mérel | and | Bucaram | 2010 | and/or | on | shadow | prices | of | resources | de | Frahan | et | al | 2007 | or | ii | estimated | programming | model | parameters | in | an | econometric | sense | using | either | cross | sectional | data | Heckelei | and | Wolff | 2003 | Buysse | et | al | 2007 | Arfini | et | al | 2008 | or | time | series | data | Jansson | and | Heckelei | 2011

In | this | paper | we | use | both | multiple | observations | cross | sectional | data | and | prior | information | on | supply | elasticities | ε | r | i | i | and | on | dual | values | of | constraints | ρ | r | m | at | NUTS | 2 | regional | level | r | 1 | 2 | R | to | calibrate | the | model | Supply | elasticities | are | taken | from | Jansson | and | Heckelei | 2011 | who | econometrically | estimated | them | at | NUTS | 2 | level | Prior | information | on | dual | values | is | derived | from | FADN | The | use | of | multiple | observations | i.e. | cross | sectional | data | allows | to | estimate | the | full | set | of | Q | f | i | i′ | coefficients | for | crop | activities | and | to | base | the | model | specification | on | observed | differences | in | behaviour | The | use | of | exogenous | information | allows | to | avoid | arbitrary | behaviour | of | the | model | in | the | simulation | phase | More | precisely | with | the | proposed | calibration | method | we | aim | not | only | to | exactly | reproduce | the | observed | activities | in | the | base | year | 2007 | 2008 | 2009 | x | f | i | 0 | as | most | of | the | PMP | methods | do | -but | also | to | ensure | that | the | estimated | NUTS2 | supply | responses | NUTS2 | averages | of | ε | f | i | i′ | and | the | estimated | dual | values | of | resources | ρ | f | m | are | as | closely | as | possible | to | the | given | ones | ε | r | i | i | ρ | r | m | To | perform | the | estimation | we | derive | the | first | order | conditions | FOCs | of | the | optimization | model | 1 | and | 2 | Heckelei | 2002 | and | then | we | apply | the | Highest | Posterior | Density | HPD | method | Heckelei | et | al | 2005 | 8 | to | estimate | the | unknown | parameters | d | f | i | Q | f | i | i′ | and | ρ | f | m

The | use | of | the | HPD | approach | for | parameter | estimation | is | carried | out | under | the | following | assumptions

The | HPD | model | minimizes | in | each | NUTS | 2 | region | the | weighted | sum | of | normalized | squared | deviations | of | estimated | regional | own | price | diagonal | supply | elasticities | and | of | farm | dual | values | of | constraints | from | the | prior | subject | to | a | set | of | data | consistency | FOC | constraints

The | normalized | squared | deviations | of | farm | dual | values | are | weighted | with | the | proportion | of | the | farm | in | the | NUTS | 2 | region | ω | w | w | f | ρ | f | f | f | to | obtain | a | weighted | average | normalized | squared | deviation | at | the | NUTS | 2 | level | where | w | f | is | the | farm | weighting | factor | reflecting | the | number | of | farms | in | the | population | that | is | represented | by | farm | f.

The | normalized | squared | deviations | of | regional | supply | elasticities | are | weighted | with | the | proportion | of | observed | activity | level | in | the | total | regional | land | ω | Nx | x | r | ε | r | i | r | i | i | r | 0 | 0 | to | allow | activities | with | a | high | proportion | of | the | area | to | dominate | where | N | r | is | the | number | of | observed | crop | activities | for | x | r | i | 0 | 0 | in | NUTS | 2 | region | r.

Prior | information | on | dual | values | ρ | r | m | are | set | to | the | average | land | rental | price | at | regional | NUTS2 | level | for | arable | and | grassland | land | to | the | gross | margin | differential | between | sugar | beet | and | the | next | best | alternative | crop | for | the | sugar | beet | quota | restriction | and | to | arable | land | rental | prices | i.e. | knowing | that | the | only | constraints | in | the | base | year | for | crops | are | land | sugar | beet | quota | and | obligatory | setaside | for | the | set | aside | obligations | Large | standard | deviations | for | prior | information | are | assumed | in | order | to | allow | for | sufficient | flexibility | around | the | prior | values | As | such | the | individual | farm | data | can | still | dominate | the | parameter | estimation | The | calibration | to | the | exogenous | supply | elasticities | is | performed | in | a | non | myopic | way | i.e. | we | take | into | account | the | effects | of | changing | dual | values | on | the | simulation | response | Heckelei | 2002 | Mérel | and | Bucaram | 2010

The | estimation | procedure | is | applied | only | to | arable | crops | The | livestock | and | feeding | activities | are | calibrated | following | the | approach | of | Helming | et | al | 2001 | with | all | off | diagonal | elements | of | Q | being | set | to | zero | 9

In | order | to | simplify | the | already | complex | estimation | problem | the | inequality | on | set | aside | and | quota | restrictions | is | replaced | with | equality | i.e. | both | restrictions | are | assumed | to | be | binding | Moreover | the | non | negativity | condition | was | omitted | due | to | the | heavy | computational | requirement | That | is | all | optimal | activity | levels | are | assumed | to | be | positive | This | implies | that | we | may | over | estimate | the | profitability | of | non | observed | activities

The | exchange | of | production | factors | and | production | rights | between | farms | is | not | allowed | i.e. | there | are | neither | land | nor | quota | markets

The | general | formulation | of | the | corresponding | HPD | problem | is | now | straightforward

The | estimation | of | B | ft | i | i′ | and | thus | Q | f | i | i′ | parameters | relies | only | on | observed | activities | on | each | farm | meaning | that | the | well | known | selfselection | problem | is | not | explicitly | handled | in | this | estimation | To | cope | with | this | problem | we | adopted | the | following | ad | hoc | modelling | decisions | in | the | simulation | phase | in | each | NUTS | 2 | region | the | gross | margin | of | the | non | observed | activities | is | equal | to | the | farm | type | average | gross | margin | the | activity | 's | quadratic | function | parameter | is | equal | to | the | activity | 's | average | quadratic | function | parameter | within | the | farm | type | and | the | linear | term | 's | quadratic | function | is | derived | from | the | difference | between | the | gross | margin | and | the | dual | values | of | constraints | 11 |  | The | constraints | 4 | and | 5 | represent | the | FOCs | of | the | optimization | model | 1 | and | 2 | for | crop | activities | and | in | quota | sugar | beet | production | respectively | Equations | 6 | and | 7 | represent | the | FOC | for | land | and | quota | constraints | Equations | 8 | and | 9 | compute | supply | elasticities | at | farm | and | NUTS2 | levels | respectively | 12 | Eq | 10 | calculates | the | farm | specific | Q | f | i | i′ | parameters | Eq | 11 | is | the | Cholesky | decomposition | which | ensures | appropriate | curvature | properties | of | the | estimated | quadratic | cost | function | i.e. | convex | in | activity | levels | Finally | Eq | 12 | calculates | farm | specific | quadratic | parameters | of | the | cost | behavioural | function

As | mentioned | above | the | primary | data | source | used | to | parameterize | IFM | CAP | are | individual | farm | level | data | from | the | FADN | database | FADN | 2015 | for | the | three | year | average | around | 2008 | 2007 | 2008 | and | 2009 | The | FADN | data | is | complemented | by | other | external | EU | wide | data | sources | such | as | the | Eurostat | FSS | and | CAPRI | databases | for | variables | not | available | in | FADN | Fig | 1 | However | most | of | these | external | data | are | not | directly | used | in | the | model | but | only | serve | as | input | in | the | estimations | 13 | In | total | 37 | crop | activities | and | 16 | animal | activities | are | represented | in | IFM | CAP | Some | minor | activities | are | grouped | in | mixed | categories | e.g. | other | cereals | other | vegetables | in | order | to | speed | up | the | computational | time | and | to | reduce | the | parametrization | complexity | of | the | model

For | each | farm | the | following | variables | are | derived | from | FADN | levels | hectares | or | number | of | animal | heads | yields | product | prices | for | all | crop | and | animal | activities | available | farmland | utilized | agricultural | area | arable | land | and | grassland | rental | prices | coupled | and | decoupled | subsidies | and | set | aside | rate | 14 | Data | on | labour | and | capital | costs | are | not | included | as | explained | before | they | are | not | explicitly | modelled | but | captured | by | the | quadratic | terms | of | the | behavioural | activity | function

Before | being | used | the | FADN | data | are | screened | and | adjusted | to | the | IFM | CAP | modelling | framework | This | includes | the | identification | and | correction | of | outliers | and | handling | the | missing | values | The | outlier | correction | is | applied | to | the | price | data | using | the | interquartile | range | rule | 1.5xIQR | The | reason | for | correcting | the | price | data | is | because | they | are | indirectly | derived | from | the | original | FADN | data | and | for | some | farms | they | may | deviate | significantly | from | the | rest | of | the | sample | 15 | The | outliers | were | replaced | with | the | regional | and | farm | type | average | prices | calculated | from | FADN

The | handling | of | missing | data | concerns | production | value | and | price | and/or | output | quantity | and | yield | for | crop | activities | for | which | a | positive | cultivated | area | is | reported | 16 | By | setting | crop | prices | or | yields | equal | to | the | average | at | regional | level | NUTS | 2 | we | derive | the | missing | data | on | production | value | and/or | output | quantity | Fodder | crops | i.e. | fodder | maize | fodder | root | crops | pasture | straw | and | other | fodder | on | arable | land | represent | a | special | case | since | only | data | on | cultivated | fodder | area | is | available | in | FADN | while | the | quantity | and | value | of | fodder | production | is | often | not | reported | in | FADN | because | it | is | usually | consumed | on | farm | In | this | case | we | use | external | sources | to | obtain | price | and | yield | data | see | further | which | then | allow | us | to | calculate | production | value | and | quantity

Data | on | unit | input | costs | of | crops | animal | feeding | and | sugar | beet | quota | are | not | directly | available | in | the | FADN | database | but | are | estimated | based | on | FADN | data | combined | with | external | data | sources | We | employ | the | HPD | estimation | approach | to | estimate | these | missing | data | in | FADN | The | advantage | of | the | HPD | in | this | context | is | that | it | allows | using | prior | 10 | We | consider | 14 | production | specializations | defined | by | the | TF14 | grouping | in | FADN | FADN | 2015

11 | This | approach | does | not | allow | farms | to | choose | activities | not | observed | in | the | same | region | and | farm | type | However | given | that | we | do | not | account | for | full | farm | structural | change | e.g. | farm | re | specialization | in | our | model | this | assumption | seems | plausible | This | consideration | is | based | on | the | assumption | that | if | activities | are | not | observed | in | other | similar | farms | it | indicates | that | they | likely | were | not | economically | feasible | because | of | various | unobserved | factors | e.g. | experience | skills | fixed | costs | environmental | conditions | that | are | not | accounted | for | in | our | model | 12 | Given | the | fact | that | yields | and | gross | margins | are | constant | per | unit | of | crop | production | activity | the | employed | supply | elasticities | can | be | defined | as | land | allocation | elasticities | with | respect | to | changes | in | gross | margins | see | Heckelei | 2002 | Heckelei | and | Wolf | 2003

policy | rate | as | established | in | the | CAP | because | for | many | farms | the | observed | rate | is | found | to | be | lower | than | the | policy | rate | This | consideration | is | made | for | the | purpose | to | avoid | data | distortions | for | activity | levels | and/or | infeasibilities | in | model | calibration | 15 | Prices | are | derived | by | dividing | production | value | and | production | quantity | The | production | value | in | turn | is | calculated | as | the | sum | of | monetary | value | of | sales | own | consumption | and | change | of | stocks | which | may | result | in | negative | very | small | or | very | large | positive | i.e. | out | of | range | values | for | the | derived | prices | for | some | products | and | farms | For | example | a | farm | with | high | carry | over | stock | and | experiencing | high | drop | in | sale | prices | may | report | a | negative | total | production | value | which | will | generate | a | negative | product | price | 16 | Since | FADN | assigns | zero | values | to | variables | for | which | data | is | not | collected | we | decided | to | also | consider | all | zero | values | for | existing | non | zero | crop | activity | levels | as | missing | values

information | directly | from | FADN | and/or | from | other | sources | as | well | as | it | allows | taking | into | account | data | consistency | constraints | Heckelei | et | al | 2005 | Heckelei | et | al | 2008 | More | details | are | provided | in | Appendix | A.

As | IFM | CAP | is | a | comparative | static | supply | model | that | does | not | take | into | account | the | dynamics | of | market | developments | and | market | interlinkages | price | feedbacks | the | baseline | construction | relies | on | an | external | baseline | 17 | More | precisely | we | use | CAPRI | projections | 18 | to | construct | the | IFM | CAP | baseline | for | the | year | 2020 | taken | as | the | time | horizon | for | running | policy | simulations | One | important | feature | of | the | CAPRI | baseline | is | that | it | is | developed | in | conjunction | with | the | European | Commission | EC | baseline | The | EC | constructs | medium | term | projections | for | the | agricultural | commodity | markets | on | an | annual | basis | The | projections | present | a | consistent | set | of | market | and | sectoral | income | prospects | elaborated | on | the | basis | of | specific | policy | and | macroeconomic | assumptions | Nii | Naate | 2011 | Himics | et | al | 2013 | Britz | and | Witzke | 2014

To | construct | the | IFM | CAP | baseline | three | assumptions | are | adopted | i | a | continuation | of | the | CAP | Health | Check | up | to | 2020 | ii | an | assumed | inflation | rate | of | 1.9 | per | year | for | input | costs | and | behavioural | function | parameters | and | iii | an | adjustment | of | baseline | prices | and | yields | using | growth | rates | from | the | CAPRI | baseline | As | the | CAPRI | growth | rates | of | yields | and | prices | are | defined | at | NUTS2 | level | we | impose | the | same | growth | rate | on | all | farms | belonging | to | the | same | NUTS2 | region | All | the | other | parameters | e.g. | farm | resource | endowments | and | farm | weighting | factors | are | assumed | to | remain | unchanged | up | to | 2020 | Structural | change | is | not | taken | into | account | i.e. | total | farm | area | is | assumed | constant | and | no | farm | exit | entry | neither | substitution | between | arable | and | grassland | are | considered

The | generated | baseline | scenario | is | used | as | the | reference | point | for | the | comparison | of | the | future | effects | of | the | crop | diversification | scenario

The | 2013 | CAP | reform | introduces | specific | measures | to | enhance | the | provision | of | public | goods | by | farmers | the | so | called | greening | payment | EU | 2013 | Under | the | CAP | greening | measures | 30 | of | direct | payments | are | conditional | on | complying | with | three | mandatory | requirements | i | crop | diversification | for | arable | crops | ii | maintenance | of | permanent | grassland | and | iii | allocation | of | 5 | of | land | to | Ecological | Focus | Areas | EFAs

In | this | paper | we | focus | on | modelling | the | crop | diversification | measure | The | crop | diversification | requirements | apply | only | to | farms | with | an | arable | area | greater | than | 10 | hectares | Farms | with | more | than | 75 | of | their | total | eligible | land | covered | by | grassland | farms | with | 75 | of | their | arable | area | cultivated | with | forage | and | organic | farms | are | not | subject | to | the | crop | diversification | measure | 19 | Furthermore | there | are | additional | requirements | for | farms | having | more | than | 30 | hectares | of | arable | land | group | 2 | compared | with | farms | with | arable | land | between | 10 | and | 30 | hectares | group | 1 | The | latter | farms | need | to | have | at | least | two | different | crops | and | the | main | crop | should | not | exceed | 75 | of | the | arable | land | The | former | farms | are | required | to | have | at | least | three | crops | and | the | main | crop | should | not | cover | more | than | 75 | of | the | arable | land | and | the | two | main | crops | together | should | not | cover | more | than | 95 | of | the | arable | land | The | simulated | policy | scenario | considers | that | all | the | farmers | would | fully | comply | with | the | requirements | imposed | by | the | regulation | Table | 1 | shows | how | crop | diversification | measure | was | modelled | in | this | study

In | this | section | we | report | the | simulation | results | for | the | EU-27 | 20 | We | first | discuss | the | number | of | farms | that | are | concerned | and | affected | by | the | measure | Then | we | analyze | how | the | crop | diversification | scenario | affects | land | use | production | and | income | effects | and | provide | results | at | MS | and | EU-27 | aggregate | level | by | farm | specialization | and | farm | size | and | for | the | full | distribution | across | the | farm | population

Table | 2 | column | A | provides | statistics | on | the | simulated | number | of | concerned | farms | i.e. | those | farms | that | are | subject | to | the | crop | diversification | measure | under | the | baseline | scenario | Out | of | the | five | million | commercial | farms | represented | in | IFM | CAP | for | the | EU-27 | only | 31 | are | concerned | the | rest | 69 | are | exempted | from | the | measure | in | the | baseline | The | latter | include | non | arable | farms | farms | with | a | small | arable | area | less | than | 10 | ha | farms | with | a | large | proportion | of | land | planted | with | fodder | crops | or | grassland | or | organic | farms | The | MSs | with | the | largest | proportion | of | concerned | farms | include | Denmark | 91 | Slovakia | 90 | Finland | 78 | Sweden | 75 | Germany | 74 | Lithuania | 69 | the | Czech | Republic | 67 | Belgium | Luxembourg | 64 | and | France | 60 | These | MSs | have | a | farm | structure | dominated | by | large | farms | and/or | by | specialized | farms | and/or | have | a | large | arable | sector | On | the | other | hand | the | smallest | proportion | of | concerned | farms | is | found | in | Malta | 1 | Ireland | 7 | Slovenia | 10 | Romania | 12 | Bulgaria | 13 | Cyprus | 13 | Portugal | 12 | and | Greece | 14 | Many | of | these | MSs | have | a | high | proportion | of | small | farms | in | the | total | commercial | farm | population | which | are | exempted | from | the | diversification | measure | The | remaining | MSs | have | a | proportion | of | concerned | farms | between | 20 | and | 60 | Table | 2 | column | A

Of | these | concerned | farms | about | 84 | is | already | in | line | with | the | diversification | measure | in | the | baseline | scenario | This | means | that | they | do | not | have | to | make | any | changes | in | their | land | allocation | in | response | to | the | crop | diversification | requirements | since | they | already | comply | anyways | As | such | they | are | not | affected | by | the | policy | The | remaining | 16 | of | concerned | farms | corresponding | to | 5 | of | the | total | commercial | farms | in | the | EU-27 | are | not | complying | with | the | diversification | measure | in | the | baseline | scenario | These | non | compliant | farms | in | the | baseline | scenario | represent | a | hypothetical | situation | in | breach | of | the | diversification | requirements | before | the | implementation | of | the | measure | These | are | the | farms | that | will | be | affected | by | the | policy | as | they | will | need | to | adjust | their | behaviour | in | order | to | comply | with | the | diversification | measure | if | they | do | not | want | to | face | a | reduction | in | subsidy | i.e. | lower | greening | payments | The | proportion | of | concerned | farms | that | are | non | compliant | in | the | baseline | and | thus | affected | by | the | policy | varies | between | 0 | in | Malta | and | 57 | in | Cyprus | Table | 2 | column | A | 17 | The | advantage | of | this | approach | is | that | we | can | indirectly | benefit | from | specialized | expert | knowledge | on | market | projections | outlooks | employed | for | the | construction | of | the | external | baseline | The | second | advantage | is | that | IFM | CAP | is | used | for | policy | impact | assessment | which | ensures | the | consistency | and | comparability | with | other | models | for | which | the | same | baseline | is | used | The | drawback | of | this | choice | is | that | consistency | may | not | be | fully | achievable | between | IFM | CAP | and | the | model | assumptions | used | for | baseline | construction | as | each | model | may | rely | on | specific | methodology | data | sources | commodity | and | geographic | aggregates | and | policy | and | economic | assumptions | Blanco | Fonseca | 2010 | 18 | For | more | information | refer | to | Blanco | Fonseca | 2010 | Britz | and | Witzke | 2014 | and | Himics | et | al | 2013 | 19 | MS | could | also | opt | to | exempt | farms | that | apply | practices | certification | or | specific | agrienvironmental | schemes | that | yield | a | level | of | benefit | for | the | climate | and | the | environment | that | is | equivalent | to | or | higher | than | the | three | greening | obligations | These | exemptions | are | not | implemented | in | the | scenario | due | to | data | limitations | 20 | The | IFM | CAP | model | is | programmed | in | GAMS | General | Algebraic | Modelling | System | and | solved | using | CONOPT | and | SBB | Standard | Branch | and | Bound | algorithm | solvers | GAMS | 2016 | CONOPT | is | applied | to | solve | the | nonlinear | program | NLP | in | calibration | and | baseline | while | SBB | is | used | to | solve | the | mixed | integer | non | linear | program | MINLP | induced | by | the | modelling | of | the | crop | diversification | scenario | because | the | restriction | on | the | number | of | crops | implies | a | discrete | choice | decision

Table | 2 | column | B | and | Table | 3 | report | the | relocated | area | induced | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | The | figures | are | calculated | by | summing | up | the | area | that | changed | its | use | over | all | farms | at | MS | and | EU | levels | Table | 2 | column | B | by | farm | specialization | Table | 3 | panel | a | and | by | farm | size | Table | 3 | panel | b | The | reallocated | area | due | to | the | diversification | measure | represents | 0.8 | of | the | total | arable | area | and | 0.6 | of | the | UAA | in | the | EU-27 | It | ranges | from | 0 | to | 5.6 | of | both | arable | area | and | UAA | across | different | MSs | Table | 2 | column | B | The | reallocated | area | is | mostly | induced | by | the | 75 | threshold | imposed | for | the | main | crop | cultivated | on | the | farm | To | illustrate | this | Fig | 2 | shows | the | contribution | of | the | 75 | and | 95 | thresholds | to | the | total | non | compliant | area | in | baseline | At | EU-27 | level | the | share | of | non | compliant | area | due | the | 75 | threshold | represents | 78 | of | the | total | non | compliant | area | while | across | MS | this | share | varies | from | 48 | in | the | Czech | Republic | to | 91 | in | Austria | Belgium | Poland | and | Slovenia | The | 95 | threshold | is | significantly | less | important | in | causing | land | use | changes | It | represents | less | than | 22 | of | the | total | non | compliant | area | in | the | EU-27 | and | ranges | between | 9 | and | 52 | at | MS | level | Fig | 2 | This | result | can | be | partly | explained | by | the | fact | that | the | 75 | threshold | concerns | all | farms | with | an | arable | area | greater | than | 10 | hectares | whereas | the | 95 | threshold | concerns | only | those | farms | with | an | arable | area | greater | than | 30 | hectares

As | reported | in | Table | 3 | panel | a | farms | with | a | significant | relocated | area | share | in | the | arable | area | or | UAA | due | to | the | diversification | measure | are | specialized | in | cereals | oilseed | and | protein | crops | This | is | in | line | with | expectations | given | that | these | are | the | farm | groups | which | are | targeted | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | Yet | some | farm | groups | not | necessarily | targeted | by | the | measure | are | also | significantly | affected | in | relative | terms | such | as | farms | specialized | in | permanent | crops | horticulture | pigs | and | poultry | dairy | and | mixed | crops | These | farms | types | typically | have | a | less | diversified | production | structure | on | their | arable | land | given | that | their | main | activity | is | not | necessarily | linked | to | arable | cropping | As | a | result | they | are | more | likely | to | breach | the | diversity | requirements | and | thus | need | to | introduce | new | crops | and/or | expand | the | smaller | crops | when | the | diversification | measure | is | introduced | For | farm | size | the | most | affected | are | middle | sized | farms | between | 6 | and | 40 | ESU | 21 | followed | by | large | farms | greater | than | 40 | ESU | and | small | farms | smaller | than | 6 | ESU | Table | 3 | panel | b | In | line | with | expectations | small | farms | are | affected | to | a | lesser | extent | because | they | are | exempted | farms | with | arable | area | smaller | than | 10 | ha | Large | farms | are | affected | less | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | because | they | usually | have | a | more | diversified | production | structure | even | in | the | absence | of | crop | diversification | measure | while | when | the | measure | is | introduced | they | need | to | undergo | relatively | small | area | adjustment | to | be | fully | compliant

The | aggregated | impacts | reported | in | Table | 3 | may | hide | sizeable | effects | for | individual | farms | To | gain | further | insight | Fig | 3 | shows | the | distribution | of | the | relocated | area | over | all | EU-27 | farms | i.e. | the | total | number | of | farms | in | the | EU-27 | is | equal | to | 100 | compared | to | the | baseline |  | This | figure | is | constructed | by | sorting | in | descending | order | all | the | farms | according | to | the | size | of | the | relocated | area | until | all | farms | 100 | are | reported | The | vertical | axis | of | Fig | 3 | starts | at | 92.5 | in | order | to | better | illustrate | the | changes | for | the | affected | farms | Although | the | reallocated | area | is | substantial | for | some | farms | more | than | a | 20 | the | total | proportion | of | farms | affected | by | the | measure | represents | only | around | 5 | of | the | total | farm | population | in | the | EU-27 | Thus | about | 95 | of | the | farm | population | is | not | affected | at | all | either | because | they | are | already | complying | in | the | baseline | or | because | they | are | not | concerned | because | they | are | exempted | from | the | crop | diversification | measure

It | is | not | straightforward | to | quantify | the | impact | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | on | production | The | production | effects | depend | on | production | structure | of | each | farm | and | to | which | extent | it | is | diversified | The | production | of | crops | that | have | large | land | share | in | the | baseline | i.e. | those | that | do | not | comply | with | the | diversification | requirements | will | tend | to | decrease | whereas | the | production | of | crops | with | low | land | shares | will | tend | to | increase | as | a | result | of | the | diversification | measure | At | aggregate | EU | MS | or | farm | type | levels | the | impact | will | depend | on | which | farm | specialization | pattern | dominates | and | this | will | determine | the | net | production | effects | across | individual | crops

Table | 4 | reports | the | production | quantity | effects | of | the | crop | diversification | at | MS | EU | level | panel | a | by | farm | specialization | panel | b | and | by | farm | size | panel | c | The | results | show | that | the | potential | production | change | caused | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | is | rather | small | The | overall | crop | production | change | at | EU-27 | level | represents | a | decline | of | around | 0.4 | compared | to | the | baseline | The | production | declines | because | farms | are | required | to | adjust | land | allocation | in | line | with | the | crop | diversity | requirements | which | they | would | not | do | in | the | absence | of | this | measure | The | largest | overall | change | in | crop | production | is | observed | in | Spain | but | its | magnitude | is | still | small | about | −1.4

The | variation | in | production | changes | across | the | reported | crops | is | between | −1.5 | and | +0.11 | at | EU-27 | level | Table | 4 | panel | a | At | MS | level | there | are | some | more | sizable | production | changes | reported | for | maize | in | the | Netherlands | +11 | for | sunflower | in | Italy | +11 | and | potatoes | in | Finland | −12 | This | is | because | these | crops | are | relatively | minor | sectors | relative | to | the | overall | size | of | the | arable | sector | However | most | of | the | production | changes | across | crops | and | MS | are | between | −5 | and | +5

The | results | by | farm | specialization | and | farm | size | aggregated | at | EU-27 | level | reveal | more | sizable | production | effects | for | certain | farm | specializations | but | they | are | still | below | 2 | for | total | crop | production | For | individual | crops | the | change | is | larger | in | particular | for | specialized | farms | e.g. | permanent | crops | horticulture | and | sheep | and | goats | due | to | the | less | diversified | production | structure | of | these | farms | on | arable | land | and | because | of | low | production | level | in | the | baseline | of | some | of | these | crops | For | farm | size | groups | as | expected | the | most | affected | are | middle | size | farm | classes | whereas | large | and | small | farms | show | smaller | changes | in | production | Table | 4 | panels | b | and | c

Figs | 4 | and | 5 | display | the | distribution | of | production | change | across | individual | farms | in | the | EU-27 | for | total | crop | production | and | for | selected | crops | respectively | The | vertical | axis | is | similar | to | that | in | Fig | 3 | with | the | exception | that | the | axis | is | cut | at | 6 | and | 3 | in | Figs | 4 | and | 5 | respectively | in | order | to | better | illustrate | the | changes | for | the | affected | farms | The | remaining | 84 | and | 87 | of | farms | that | are | not | shown | in | the | figures | have | zero | production | change | Fig | 4 | shows | that | only | a | small | share | of | farms | around | 5 | register | a | change | in | total | crop | production | in | EU-27 | which | is | in | line | with | Fig | 3 | For | most | of | these | the | change | in | total | production | is | limited | less | than | 10 | Only | a | small | number | of | farms | experiences | larger | changes | in | total | production | reaching | up | to | −50 | or | +100 | 22 | The | share | of | farms | experiencing | a | change | in | production | is | around | 2.95 | for | barley | 2.04 | for | wheat | 1.37 | for | sunflower | 1.30 | for | maize | 0.86 | for | pulses | 0.84 | for | potatoes | 0.76 | for | rape | and | 0.21 | for | sugar | beet

The | income | effects | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | can | be | explained | by | the | land | reallocation | and | the | production | effects | reported | above | Table | 2 | column | C | and | Table | 5 | report | the | income | effects | at | MS/ | EU | level | Table | 2 | column | C | by | farm | specialization | Table | 5 | panel | a | and | farm | size | Table | 5 | panel | b | The | results | show | that | the | potential | decrease | in | income | caused | by | the | implementation | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | is | very | small | The | overall | income | loss | represents | less | than | 0.5 | compared | with | the | baseline | at | MS | and | EU | levels | Table | 2 | column | C | The | largest | decrease | in | income | is | observed | in | Finland | but | its | magnitude | is | still | small | about | −0.35 | The | results | by | farm | production | specialization | and | farm | size | aggregated | at | EU | level | reveal | more | sizable | income | effects | for | certain | farm | specializations | but | they | are | still | below | 2 | However | at | MS | level | the | income | may | change | up | to | 12 | for | certain | farm | specializations | and | up | to | around | 1.5 | for | certain | farm | sizes | Table | 5 | panel | a | and | b

The | most | affected | are | farms | specializing | in | cereals | oilseeds | and | protein | crops | and | general | field | cropping | The | income | decrease | in | these | farm | types | varies | considerably | across | MSs | it | reaches | up | to | 12 | compared | to | baseline | for | certain | MSs | Table | 5 | panel | a | This | is | in | line | with | expectations | given | that | the | crop | diversification | measure | targets | arable | farming | These | farm | types | are | followed | by | farms | specialized | in | horticulture | cattle | rearing | dairy | and | mixed | farms | As | explained | above | these | farm | types | often | have | a | less | diversified | production | structure | on | their | arable | land | given | that | they | specialize | in | non | arable | cropping | related | activities | They | are | more | likely | to | breach | the | minimum | requirement | on | the | number | of | crops | in | the | baseline | and | thus | need | to | introduce | new | crops | in | the | diversification | scenario | which | is | more | costly | than | the | relocation | of | land | among | existing | crops | to | fulfil | the | 75 | and/ | or | 95 | thresholds | For | the | remaining | farm | specializations | the | maximum | decrease | in | income | across | the | MSs | is | very | small | less | than | −1 | compared | to | the | baseline | Table | 5 | panel | a

By | economic | size | the | most | affected | are | farms | in | the | middle | class | between | 8 | and | 16 | ESUs | followed | by | large | ones | Small | farms | are | only | marginally | affected | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | Table | 5 | panel | a | because | they | are | exempted | from | the | crop | diversification | measure | or | are | subject | to | less | strict | diversification | requirements

Fig | 6 | shows | the | distribution | of | the | income | change | relative | to | the | baseline | across | the | whole | farm | population | in | EU-27 | The | vertical | axis | is | cut | at | 6 | in | order | to | better | illustrate | the | changes | for | the | affected | farms | The | remaining | farms | 84 | have | zero | income | change | As | shown | in | this | figure | only | a | small | proportion | of | farms | is | affected | by | the | diversification | measure | Although | the | income | decrease | of | some | farms | is | substantial | more | than | a | 25 | decline | for | 0.12 | of | farms | the | total | proportion | of | farms | affected | by | the | measure | represents | only | around | 5 | of | the | total | farm | population | in | the | EU-27 | For | most | of | these | i.e. | 4.1 | income | reduces | by | less | than | 5 | while | only | 0.9 | of | experience | an | income | decrease | of | more | than | 5 | Note | that | the | few | farms | with | a | large | income | decrease | more | than | 25 | shown | in | Fig | 6 | usually | correspond | to | farms | with | a | very | low | income | level | attained | in | baseline | Fig | 7 | shows | the | distribution | of | compliance | costs | with | CAP | crop | diversification | across | the | farm | population | in | EU-27 | These | costs | represent | the | per | hectare | income | loss | due | to | the | adoption | of | crop | 22 | For | individual | crops | a | 100 | production | change | means | that | farms | introduce | it | as | a | footnote | continued | new | crop | For | total | crop | production | the | 100 | change | means | that | farms | are | not | cultivating | any | marketable | crops | on | arable | land | in | the | baseline | hence | cultivating | only | intermediate | crops | as | fodder | crops | and | diversify | into | marketable | crops | in | the | diversification | scenario | Note | that | we | aggregate | production | across | marketable | crop | outputs | as | a | result | of | which | intermediate | outputs | e.g. | fodder | are | not | included | in | the | total | crop | production

K. | Louhichi | et | al | Land | Use | Policy | 66 | 2017 | 250 | 264 | diversification | requirements | Out | of | 5 | affected | farms | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | 1.4 | of | farms | have | compliance | costs | greater | than | 50 | EUR | per | arable | area | The | rest | of | farms | 3.6 | have | costs | lower | than | 50 | EUR | per | ha | A | small | share | of | farms | 0.2 | of | all | farms | in | EU-27 | with | high | compliance | costs | reaching | 400 | EUR | per | ha | or | more | often | own | small | arable | area | and/or | are | specialized | in | capital | and | labour | intensive | activities | e.g. | vegetable | production | granivores | with | high | per | hectare | production | and | income

The | available | studies | in | the | literature | which | estimate | the | CAP | greening | impacts | at | farm | level | vary | considerable | in | terms | of | the | regional | coverage | methodology | data | source | farm | coverage | and | CAP | greening | measures | covered | Hence | it | is | not | straightforward | to | compare | our | analysis | with | the | results | obtained | in | the | literature | Despite | this | limitation | in | the | following | we | aim | to | conduct | a | comparative | analysis | to | benchmark | our | estimates

The | share | of | affected | farms | reported | in | our | paper | is | close | in | magnitude | to | the | findings | in | the | literature | For | example | based | on | the | 2007 | Italian | Agricultural | Census | Vanni | and | Cardillo | 2013 | estimate | that | the | crop | diversification | measure | would | affect | 3.8 | of | Italian | farms | which | is | slightly | lower | than | our | estimate | of | 4.5 | This | is | expected | as | we | model | only | commercial | farms | whereas | census | data | also | include | small | non | commercial | farms | which | are | exempted | from | the | greening | policy | In | contrast | Solazzo | and | Pierangeli | 2016 | report | a | significantly | greater | share | of | affected | farms | 12.3 | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | for | Northern | Italy | using | a | combination | of | FADN | data | and | the | Integrated | Administration | and | Control | System | database | IACS | micro | data | for | 2012 | The | reason | for | this | difference | with | our | results | is | related | to | their | focus | on | selected | regions | of | Italy | only | as | well | as | their | use | of | single | year | data | for | model | calibration | compared | to | our | three | year | average | data | Based | on | survey | data | from | 2010 | DEFRA | 2013 | estimates | for | England | that | about | 7.0 | of | farms | will | be | affected | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | which | is | slightly | lower | than | our | estimate | of | 7.8 | for | UK

In | terms | of | income | effects | consistently | with | our | findings | other | studies | also | report | a | small | and | negative | income | change | due | to | the | introduction | of | crop | diversification | at | MS | or | regional | level | such | as | Was | et | al | 2014 | for | Poland | Mahy | et | al | 2015 | for | Belgium | Solazzo | and | Pierangeli | 2016 | and | Cortignani | et | al | 2017 | for | Italian | regions | Our | results | also | show | that | the | income | effects | are | not | homogenously | distributed | among | farms | but | specialized | farms | may | suffer | heavy | losses | This | is | supported | by | Cimino | et | al | 2015 | whose | estimates | show | substantial | negative | income | effects | of | crop | diversification | on | specialized | farms | in | Italy | Also | Solazzo | et | al | 2015a | b | found | that | in | the | Emilia | Romagna | Italy | the | economic | losses | are | bigger | for | farms | specialized | in | field | crops | and | livestock | farms | with | predominant | monoculture | or | low | number | of | production | processes | and | large | arable | crop | areas

Our | simulation | results | expect | a | relatively | small | change | in | land | use | caused | by | the | crop | diversification | measure | The | comparison | of | our | results | with | the | findings | in | the | literature | is | not | readily | possible | given | that | studies | often | report | area | of | concerned | farms | e.g. | Vanni | and | Cardillo | 2013 | or | net | land | use | changes | caused | by | specific | greening | measures | e.g. | Gocht | et | al | 2016 | or | all | greening | measures | combined | e.g. | Solazzo | and | Pierangeli | 2016 | Solazzo | et | al | 2015a | b | instead | of | reporting | the | actually | relocated | area | between | different | crops | However | in | line | with | our | simulations | the | literature | confirms | that | the | impact | of | crop | diversification | measure | on | land | use | is | rather | limited | either | because | of | the | existence | of | various | exemption | rules | or | because | many | farms | have | sufficiently | diversified | production | structure | even | in | the | absence | of | the | crop | diversification | measure

Although | the | current | version | of | the | IFM | CAP | model | does | not | simulate | the | environmental | effects | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | directly | the | limited | changes | in | land | allocation | reported | in | our | paper | and | other | studies | allow | us | to | infer | that | the | environmental | benefits | are | expected | to | be | rather | low | This | is | confirmed | by | Gocht | et | al | 2016 | who | simulate | environmental | impacts | of | crop | diversification | measure | in | EU | using | a | representative | farm | model | CAPRI | Although | their | results | are | subject | to | some | aggregation | bias | because | they | use | a | representative | farm | model | their | simulations | reveal | very | small | environmental | impacts | of | crop | diversification | measure | According | to | Gocht | et | al | 2016 | the | crop | diversification | measure | has | almost | zero | impact | on | the | greenhouse | gas | emissions | and | soil | erosion | and | hardly | any | effect | on | ammonia | emissions | Some | positive | environmental | improvement | is | observed | only | for | biodiversity | friendly | farming | practices | and | nitrogen | surplus

One | needs | to | be | aware | when | drawing | conclusions | that | our | findings | obviously | reflect | the | model | assumptions | First | of | all | the | model | is | calibrated | on | the | average | values | over | the | three | years | 2007 | 2008 | and | 2009 | instead | of | single | year | data | As | the | farm | production | plan | of | an | average | year | is | less | specialized | than | that | of | a | single | year | i.e. | the | number | of | crops | of | an | average | year | will | most | likely | be | higher | than | the | number | of | crops | in | each | single | year | this | implies | that | the | crop |  | diversification | constraint | will | be | somewhat | less | binding | in | our | model | than | it | is | in | reality | Therefore | our | results | will | underestimate | the | noncompliant | area | in | the | baseline | scenario | although | we | believe | that | the | bias | introduced | in | this | way | is | limited | On | the | other | hand | using | a | threeyear | average | has | the | advantage | of | making | our | model | less | sensitive | to | year | specific | fluctuations | in | price | yield | and | crop | allocation | data | which | can | be | expected | to | be | especially | high | when | using | individual | farm | level | data

A | second | potential | caveat | in | our | analysis | is | that | we | assume | a | fixed | organizational | structure | implying | that | land | can | be | reallocated | only | within | farms | in | response | to | the | introduction | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | In | reality | farmers | can | reallocate | land | between | farms | or | may | decide | to | adjust | other | elements | of | farm | organization | that | are | not | necessarily | linked | to | land | allocation | For | example | farms | may | enter | into | un)official | arrangements | with | neighbouring | farms | to | rearrange | claims | for | the | greening | payments | in | order | to | ensure | compliance | and | thus | to | avoid | the | decrease | in | income | related | to | potential | land | relocation | If | this | is | the | case | our | results | overestimate | the | overall | effect | Modelling | farmers | cooperation | would | require | information | on | personal | relationships | farm | locations | etc | which | is | lacking | and | beyond | the | scope | of | this | paper

Third | we | do | not | take | market | feedbacks | output | price | changes | into | account | in | the | model | e.g. | see | Van | Zeijts | et | al | 2011 | Gocht | et | al | 2016 | IFM | CAP | provides | only | first | round | effects | without | taking | into | account | market | adjustments | Thus | not | only | are | the | first | round | income |  | Table | 5 | Income | change | due | to | diversification | measure | farm | specialization | a | and | farm | size | b | relative | change | to | baseline

effects | projected | to | be | small | but | the | market | responses | to | the | reduction | in | production | may | reduce | them | even | further | Fourth | certain | crops | are | defined | in | the | model | as | an | aggregation | of | a | set | of | individual | crops | e.g. | other | cereals | which | may | also | lead | to | an | overestimation | of | the | simulated | impacts | Fifth | the | FADN | includes | only | commercial | farms | whereas | small | non | commercial | farms | are | underrepresented | in | the | database | which | may | lead | to | an | overestimation | of | the | simulated | impacts | as | small | farms | are | exempted | from | the | greening | Sixth | the | direct | payments | considered | in | the | simulation | are | based | on | the | system | in | place | prior | to | the | 2013 | CAP | reform | as | available | in | FADN | data

Seventh | the | model | specification | assumes | that | farmers | decisions | are | uniquely | driven | by | profit | maximizing | behaviour | Although | the | model | was | applied | to | only | FADN | commercial | farmers | whose | behaviour | is | presumably | driven | by | profit | maximization | this | assumption | could | be | unrealistic | when | the | presence | of | risk | aversion | leads | to | production | decisions | that | conflict | with | the | profit | maximizing | behaviour | in | which | case | utility | maximization | may | be | a | more | appropriate | approach | However | we | believe | that | the | impact | of | this | limitation | on | model | results | is | limited | because | the | PMP | calibration | terms | implicitly | capture | farmers | attitudes | towards | risk | and | uncertainty | Arribas | et | al | 2017 | tested | and | compared | the | feasibility | and | performance | of | a | large | PMP | farm | model | with | and | without | risk | specification | using | a | mean | variance | approximation | to | expected | utility | Their | main | finding | is | that | both | specificationsaccounting | or | not | for | risk | -yield | very | close | estimates | They | also | concluded | that | the | consideration | of | risk | would | be | mainly | relevant | for | the | assessment | of | risk | management | tools | which | is | not | the | case | in | this | paper | Moreover | it | is | important | to | notice | that | the | explicit | modelling | of | risk | in | PMP | models | is | not | straightforward | and | only | very | few | examples | have | been | proposed | and | tested | at | farm | level | using | small | samples | only | Petsakos | and | Rozakis | 2015 | Jansson | et | al | 2014 | Beyond | risk | a | variety | of | other | factors | may | affect | farmers | utility | including | leisure | environmental | attitudes | and | others | Gómez | Limón | et | al | 2003 | however | the | specification | and | the | modelling | of | these | factors | as | well | as | the | model | calibration | are | challenging | due | to | data | availability | and | computational | limitations

Finally | regarding | the | policy | scenario | assumptions | not | all | the | specificities | regarding | the | greening | implementation | are | considered | in | the | model | In | particular | it | is | not | considered | that | farmers | in | the | small | farmers | scheme | farmers | north | of | 62nd | parallel | and | farms | with | more | than | 75 | of | the | crops | under | water | are | exempted | from | the | greening | obligations | In | addition | MSs | can | opt | to | define | practices | that | yield | an | equivalent | or | higher | beneficial | effect | for | the | climate | and | the | environment | as | the | greening | obligations | Farms | adopting | these | practices | are | exempted | from | the | greening | which | was | also | not | considered | in | the | current | paper

A | careful | analysis | of | each | of | these | limitations | to | the | current | model | is | needed | to | test | the | robustness | of | these | results | and | to | provide | a | complete | picture | of | the | EU | wide | impact | of | the | crop | diversification | measure

This | paper | presents | the | EU | wide | impacts | of | crop | diversification | measure | on | the | European | farming | sector | The | crop | diversification | measure | was | adopted | as | part | of | the | CAP | greening | within | the | 2013 | CAP | reform | To | quantify | the | impacts | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | we | have | employed | a | novel | individual | farm | level | model | IFM | CAP | Based | on | positive | mathematical | programming | IFM | CAP | seeks | to | improve | the | quality | of | policy | assessment | upon | existing | regional | and | aggregated | farm | type | models | and | to | assess | distributional | effects | over | the | EU | farm | population | To | guarantee | the | highest | representativeness | of | the | EU | agricultural | sector | the | model | is | applied | to | every | FADN | individual | farm | around | 60,500 | farms

From | a | policy | perspective | the | main | findings | of | this | paper | suggest | that | the | effect | of | crop | diversification | on | farm | income | is | rather | limited | at | the | aggregate | level | Agricultural | income | at | MS | level | decreases | by | less | than | 0.5 | At | the | individual | farm | level | the | impact | could | be | more | pronounced | more | than | −25 | although | the | number | of | affected | farms | by | the | measure | remains | small | around | 5 | of | the | total | farm | population | The | proportion | of | the | reallocated | area | due | to | the | diversification | measure | represents | less | than | 1 | of | the | total | agricultural | area | while | the | crop | production | declines | by | less | than | 0.5 | in | EU-27 | The | most | constraining | component | of | the | diversification | measure | appears | to | be | the | 75 | threshold | imposed | for | the | main | cultivated | crop | for | farms | with | an | arable | area | greater | than | 10 | ha

The | small | land | use | impacts | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | simulated | in | our | paper | indicate | that | the | expected | environmental | impacts | may | be | limited | and | that | its | contribution | to | enhancing | the | CAP | efficiency | in | provision | of | public | goods | to | the | society | might | be | small | Other | studies | also | pointed | to | the | potentially | limited | environmental | effects | of | the | greening | measures | e.g. | Solazzo | et | al | 2015a | b | Erjavec | and | Erjavec | 2015 | Gocht | et | al | 2016 | In | addition | when | adding | the | costs | of | monitoring | and | implementation | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | the | overall | societal | benefit | might | be | insignificant | Cortignani | et | al | 2017 | However | the | proponents | of | CAP | greening | in | general | and | the | crop | diversification | policy | in | particular | argue | that | their | inclusion | in | CAP | can | be | considered | as | a | first | political | step | necessary | to | be | undertaken | in | order | to | open | the | door | for | the | future | adoption | of | novel | agricultural | policy | measures | that | promote | better | environmental | performance | of | EU | farming | sector

The | most | commonly | advocated | proposal | in | the | scientific | and | political | debates | to | improve | the | efficiency | of | crop | diversification | measure | considers | a | better | targeting | of | the | environmental | requirements | across | different | farm | typologies | e.g. | specializations | and | farm | locations | European | Parliament | 2016 | This | is | confirmed | in | our | results | which | show | that | the | effects | of | crop | diversification | measure | across | different | farm | types | and | EU | regions | are | highly | heterogeneous | Although | the | aggregate | impacts | are | rather | low | farms | specialized | in | permanent | crops | and | some | livestock | or | mixed | farms | are | often | more | affected | in | relative | terms | than | arable | farms | which | were | the | primary | target | of | the | measure | The | main | explanation | is | that | the | former | farm | types | usually | have | less | diversified | production | on | arable | land | and | have | fewer | or | more | costly | options | to | diversify | into | new | arable | crops | given | that | their | main | specialization | is | not | arable | farming | Our | results | also | suggest | heterogeneous | impacts | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | across | farm | sizes | The | middle | sized | farms | tend | to | bear | the | greatest | impact | of | the | crop | diversification | measure | in | comparison | to | small | and | large | farms | In | line | with | policy | objectives | small | farms | are | only | slightly | impacted | because | they | are | exempted | from | the | measure | Large | farms | are | less | affected | because | they | usually | have | sufficiently | diversified | production | structures | also | in | the | absence | of | crop | diversification | measure | Further | our | results | suggest | that | the | impacts | are | heterogeneous | across | MS | which | is | mainly | driven | by | variation | in | farm | structure | Overall | these | results | suggest | that | the | crop | diversification | measure | needs | to | be | tailored | to | better | reflect | the | farm | heterogeneity | across | EU | in | order | to | make | a | more | homogenous | dispersion | of | the | impacts | across | farms | and | regions | and | to | avoid | unintended | impacts | on | certain | farm | specializations | e.g. | permanent | crop | farms
