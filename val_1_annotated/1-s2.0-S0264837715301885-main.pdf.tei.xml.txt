Almost | all | rural | areas | in | Europe | have | been | shaped | or | altered | by | humans | and | can | be | considered | cultural | landscapes | many | of | which | now | are | considered | to | entail | valuable | cultural | heritage | Current | dynamics | in | land | management | have | put | cultural | landscapes | under | a | huge | pressure | of | agricultural | intensification | and | land | abandonment | To | prevent | the | loss | of | cultural | landscapes | knowledge | on | the | location | of | different | types | of | cultural | landscapes | is | needed | In | this | paper | we | present | a | characterization | of | European | cultural | landscapes | based | on | the | prevalence | of | three | key | dimensions | of | cultural | landscapes | landscape | structure | management | intensity | and | value | and | meaning | We | mapped | these | dimensions | across | Europe | at | a | 1 | km | resolution | by | combining | proxies | on | management | intensity | and | landscape | structure | with | new | indicators | such | as | social | media | usage | and | registered | traditional | food | products | We | integrated | the | three | dimensions | into | a | continuous | cultural | landscape | index | that | allows | for | a | characterization | of | Europe | 's | rural | landscapes | The | characterization | identifies | hotspots | of | cultural | landscapes | where | all | three | dimensions | are | present | such | as | in | the | Mediterranean | On | the | other | hand | Eastern | and | Northern | European | cultural | landscapes | are | mostly | characterized | by | only | one | of | the | dimensions | Our | paper | can | help | to | identify | pressures | to | cultural | landscapes | and | thus | to | target | measures | for | the | conservation | of | these | landscapes | to | link | similar | landscapes | in | different | regions | and | to | inform | policy | design | on | the | most | important | characteristics | of | cultural | landscapes | at | a | regional | scale

Almost | all | rural | areas | in | Europe | have | been | shaped | or | altered | by | humans | and | can | be | regarded | a | cultural | landscape | many | of | which | now | are | considered | to | entail | valuable | cultural | heritage | Across | Europe | cultural | landscapes | have | diverging | characteristics | For | instance | the | narrow | low | lying | fields | of | the | Dutch | and | German | Marschhufen | differ | significantly | from | the | wide | open | Iberian | dehesas | but | both | are | considered | typical | cultural | landscapes | for | a | good | overview | see | Zimmermann | 2006 | What | they | do | have | in | common | is | that | they | often | provide | valuable | cultural | ecosystem | introduction | of | cultural | landscapes | into | the | UNESCO | World | Heritage | Convention | on | the | basis | of | their | cultural | heritage | Rössler | 2006 | In | addition | to | the | classical | definition | Jones | 1991 | identified | two | alternative | interpretations | of | cultural | landscapes | one | that | defines | cultural | landscapes | as | valued | features | threatened | by | change | or | disappearance | and | one | where | a | cultural | landscape | is | seen | as | subjective | focussing | on | the | intangible | values | and | meanings | people | attach | to | them

Cultural | landscapes | are | the | result | of | the | long | term | complex | interactions | between | humans | and | nature | and | thus | contain | cultural | heritage | Plieninger | and | Bieling | 2012 | In | this | respect | the | term | cultural | becomes | a | value | laden | concept | with | the | attention | focused | on | those | landscapes | that | are | denoted | as | traditional | landscapes | Agnoletti | 2014 | Antrop | 1997 | Bignal | and | McCracken | 1996 | Fischer | et | al | 2012 | Plieninger | et | al | 2006 | Antrop | 1997 | defines | traditional | landscapes | as | those | landscapes | having | a | distinct | and | recognizable | structure | which | reflects | clear | relations | between | the | composing | elements | and | having | significance | for | natural | cultural | or | aesthetical | values | From | a | cultural | geography | perspective | scholars | point | at | the | origin | of | the | landscape | somewhere | between | the | Renaissance | and | the | Industrial | Revolution | and | emphasize | the | lowintensity | farming | or | livestock | raising | taking | place | in | traditional | landscapes | Plieninger | et | al | 2006 | Consequently | the | terms | traditional | landscape | Antrop | 1997 | and | low | intensity | farmland | Bignal | and | McCracken | 1996 | are | sometimes | used | interchangeably | with | the | value | laden | concept | of | cultural | landscapes

Cultural | landscapes | in | Europe | are | threatened | Growing | demand | for | food | and | progress | in | technology | triggered | a | large | scale | intensification | of | agriculture | in | highly | productive | areas | In | contrast | less | fertile | land | or | land | less | suitable | for | intensive | agriculture | faces | land | abandonment | Estel | et | al | 2015 | Kizos | et | al | 2009 | Kuemmerle | et | al | 2008 | This | polarization | of | intensification | on | the | one | hand | and | land | abandonment | on | the | other | also | induces | a | shift | in | the | goods | and | services | provided | by | cultural | landscapes | Intensification | increases | agricultural | commodity | production | but | often | at | the | expense | of | a | broad | range | of | cultural | services | including | cultural | heritage | and | identity | Plieninger | and | Bieling | 2012 | Likewise | land | abandonment | can | lead | to | a | loss | of | the | heritage | embedded | in | the | structure | and | composition | of | these | landscapes | Van | der | Zanden | 2016b | These | changes | can | be | seen | as | decoupling | of | the | links | between | humans | and | nature | or | so | called | social | ecological | linkages | Fischer | et | al | 2012 | Plieninger | et | al | 2015 | To | understand | which | cultural | landscapes | are | at | risk | from | these | dynamics | to | develop | countermeasures | to | protect | these | landscapes | and | ensure | a | balance | in | the | provisioning | of | different | ecosystem | services | and | more | generally | to | retain | social | ecological | linkages | in | landscapes | knowledge | on | the | location | of | different | types | of | cultural | landscapes | is | essential

Existing | spatially | explicit | typologies | and | characterizations | of | cultural | landscapes | rely | mostly | on | biophysical | factors | such | as | topography | climate | soil | or | land | cover | Hazeu | et | al | 2010 | Meeus | 1995 | These | biophysical | factors | however | fail | to | characterize | the | social | side | of | the | coupled | social | ecological | systems | the | cultural | In | this | paper | we | propose | a | new | landscape | characterization | that | explicitly | incorporates | this | cultural | aspect | of | the | landscape | by | focussing | on | how | people | have | altered | the | landscape | but | also | on | how | the | landscape | is | perceived | by | people | We | adopted | a | comprehensive | understanding | of | the | term | cultural | landscape | by | including | all | agricultural | and | forest | landscapes | but | at | the | same | time | also | interpreting | the | adjective | cultural | as | value | laden | adopting | the | different | approaches | as | outlined | by | Jones | 1991 | In | this | paper | we | chose | to | focus | on | rural | landscapes | excluding | urban | landscapes | as | they | would | require | a | different | approach | With | this | definition | we | acknowledge | that | all | landscapes | have | value | to | people | but | these | values | tend | to | differ | across | Europe

Despite | the | diversity | of | cultural | landscapes | three | dimensions | of | cultural | landscapes | are | frequently | applied | to | describe | them | 1 | management | intensity | shows | how | people | use | the | landscape | Bignal | and | McCracken | 1996 | Plieninger | et | al | 2006 | 2 | landscape | structure | reveals | how | people | use | the | landscape | but | often | also | contains | traces | of | how | the | landscape | was | cultivated | in | history | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2016a | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2013 | and | 3 | value | and | meaning | is | often | used | as | an | umbrella | term | for | how | landscape | is | perceived | by | people | Plieninger | et | al | 2015 | Rössler | 2006

In | the | literature | cultural | landscapes | are | generally | described | as | landscapes | where | agriculture | is | carried | out | with | a | low | level | of | external | inputs | and | by | relatively | small | sized | family | farms | One | of | the | major | threats | to | the | cultural | value | of | these | landscapes | is | therefore | directly | related | to | intensification | of | land | management | In | terms | of | landscape | structure | cultural | landscapes | are | often | characterized | by | smaller | fields | and | the | presence | of | landscape | elements | that | reflect | former | management | such | as | hedgerows | or | stonewalls | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2013 | Finally | regarding | the | value | and | meaning | of | the | landscape | for | people | within | a | certain | context | Plieninger | et | al | 2015 | the | cognitive | aspect | of | the | landscape | involves | ways | in | which | landscapes | are | perceived | understood | and | mentally | structured | by | different | groups | in | society | Plieninger | and | Bieling | 2012

These | three | dimensions | form | the | backbone | of | the | characterization | developed | in | this | paper | We | mapped | each | dimension | with | two | or | more | spatial | variables | across | Europe | The | characterization | presented | in | this | paper | as | well | as | the | underlying | data | can | be | further | explored | through | the | HERCULES | Knowledge | Hub | http://labs.kh | hercules-landscapes.eu/landscape | typologies.html | a | tool | where | users | can | alter | the | rules | applied | to | map | cultural | landscapes | to | create | their | own | characterization | using | our | indicators

For | each | of | the | three | dimensions | of | cultural | landscapes | management | intensity | structure | and | value | and | meaning | we | derived | a | score | between | 0 | and | 1 | for | each | landscape | pixel | of | 1 | km | 2 | in | Europe | EU27 | Switzerland | High | scores | indicate | a | higher | correspondence | with | landscapes | that | are | commonly | denoted | as | cultural | landscapes | With | the | score | for | each | dimension | we | carried | out | two | analyses | The | first | was | the | calculation | of | the | average | of | the | scores | yielding | a | continuous | cultural | landscape | index | score | This | index | shows | which | landscapes | most | likely | resemble | the | traditional | landscape | as | defined | in | the | literature | A | higher | index | score | does | not | imply | more | cultural | value | as | landscapes | can | have | different | value | to | different | people | Jones | 1991 | The | emphasis | in | this | paper | in | on | the | second | analysis | where | a | characterization | based | on | the | relative | score | of | each | dimension | for | each | individual | landscape | was | produced | Scores | for | each | dimension | are | split | into | high | and | low | classes | Three | dichotomous | scores | for | each | landscape | pixel | resulted | into | eight | different | landscape | types

To | assess | the | effect | of | the | thresholds | between | high | and | low | values | chosen | we | performed | a | sensitivity | analysis | We | divided | the | distribution | of | each | dimension | score | with | eight | quantiles | to | be | used | as | alternative | thresholds | We | generated | a | characterization | for | each | possible | combination | of | the | different | quantiles | resulting | in | 9 | 3 | 729 | possible | different | characterizations | For | the | final | landscape | characterization | we | assigned | the | landscape | type | that | occurred | most | frequently | among | the | 729 | characterizations | To | quantify | the | sensitivity | of | the | characterization | to | the | threshold | we | mapped | how | often | the | most | frequently | assigned | landscape | type | occurred | as | a | percentage | of | the | total | number | of | characterizations | The | frequency | of | occurrence | of | the | landscape | type | during | the | sensitivity | analysis | is | referred | to | as | the | agreement | score

To | operationalize | the | three | dimensions | of | cultural | landscapes | we | used | a | broad | set | of | spatially | explicit | proxies | Table | 1 | available | for | the | entire | study | area | In | case | a | EU27 | wide | dataset | did | not | cover | Switzerland | we | used | comparable | Swiss | national | datasets | We | used | different | data | to | map | the | cultural | landscape | dimensions | in | arable | land | grassland | permanent | crops | and | forest | areas | given | the | very | different | character | of | these | two | landscape | types | To | assign | the | data | to | different | land | cover | classes | we | used | the | most | recent | version | of | CORINE | land | cover | at | the | time | of | analysis | i.e. | CORINE | 2006 | for | all | countries | except | Greece | where | CORINE | 2000 | was | used | EEA | 2012 | We | re | classified | the | CORINE | map | to | seven | classes | arable | land | grassland | permanent | crops | forest | urban | nature | and | water | and | aggregated | the | 100 | m | data | to | the | 1 | km | grid | using | a | constrained | aggregation | procedure | in | which | the | prevalence | of | the | different | land | cover | types | in | the | original | map | was | kept | constant | Verburg | et | al | 2006 | Urban | nature | and | water | were | not | addressed | in | this | study | as | we | were | interested | in | a | characterization | of | agricultural | and | forest | landscapes | only | Due | to | the | different | characteristics | of | forests | and | agricultural | landscapes | in | terms | of | land | management | and | structure | the | characterization | was | done | separately | for | these | two | broad | land | cover | classes

Management | intensity | can | be | measured | based | on | inputs | fertilizer | labor | mechanization | outputs | produced | goods | or | metrics | based | on | system | properties | Erb | et | al | 2013 | and | appropriate | intensity | measures | differ | for | broad | land | uses | Since | our | characterization | focusses | on | four | broad | land | use | cover | classes | arable | land | pastures | permanent | crops | and | forests | we | used | multiple | proxies | for | management | intensity | Following | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2016a | we | used | nitrogen | input | as | an | indicator | for | agricultural | intensity | as | it | a | common | way | of | approximating | management | intensity | in | a | spatially | explicit | way | Overmars | et | al | 2014 | Temme | and | Verburg | 2011 | Nitrogen | input | measured | as | kg | N | ha | yr | was | derived | from | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | Regionalized | Impact | Modeling | System | CAPRI | database | where | nitrogen | input | is | available | per | crop | type | per | NUTS2 | administrative | region | Britz | 2005 | These | data | were | spatially | allocated | to | the | 1 | km | grid | per | crop | type | and | classified | into | three | categories | 0 | 50 | N | kg | ha | 50 | 150 | N | kg | ha | and | 150 | N | kg | ha | per | year | Extrapolation | was | done | through | country | specific | regression | models | based | on | environmental | and | socio | economic | covariates | Temme | and | Verburg | 2011 | Grassland | nitrogen | input | was | based | on | livestock | density | Neumann | et | al | 2009 | assuming | an | annual | nitrogen | input | of | 100 | kg | per | cow | per | year | Van | der | Hoek | 1998 | We | categorized | these | data | into | two | classes | low | 100 | N | kg | ha | yr | and | high | 100 | N | kg | ha | yr | N | input | and | normalized | to | a | score | between | zero | high | input | and | one | low | input | N | input | data | for | Switzerland | were | obtained | from | a | Swiss | national | monitor | Hürdler | et | al | 2015 | and | classes | were | matched | with | the | classes | from | CAPRI

Nitrogen | input | data | are | not | available | for | permanent | crops | To | measure | the | management | intensity | of | permanent | crop | fields | we | used | the | energy | content | output | i.e. | the | sum | of | food | feed | pruning | of | trees | residues | of | permanent | crops | and | straw | derived | from | the | CAPRI | model | database | Paracchini | et | al | 2014 | The | energy | content | output | ECO | was | normalized | to | a | score | between | zero | and | one | where | one | refers | to | a | low | intensity | and | zero | to | a | high | intensity | We | capped | values | above | and | below | two | standard | deviations | to | eliminate | the | influence | of | extreme | outliers | ECO | for | permanent | crops | in | Switzerland | was | approximated | using | the | average | ECO | from | permanent | crops | in | neighboring | country | Austria

To | distinguish | between | capital | intensive | large | scale | farms | and | small | scale | farms | we | included | the | economic | farm | size | as | a | second | indicator | of | management | intensity | This | indicator | represents | the | economic | size | of | an | agricultural | holding | in | European | Size | Units | ESU | 1200 | D | and | was | derived | at | NUTS-3 | level | as | the | mean | over | the | years | 2007 | -2009 | European | Commission | 2012 | Economic | farm | size | was | normalized | to | a | score | between | zero | and | one | where | one | refers | to | small | farms | and | zero | to | large | farms | For | Switzerland | we | used | the | averaged | equivalent | of | ESU | per | Kanton | for | the | years | of | 2007 | -2009 | Bundesamt | für | Statistik | 2009 | For | arable | land | pasture | and | permanent | crops | a | final | management | intensity | score | was | calculated | as | the | average | of | the | indicators | for | nitrogen | input | arable | pasture | or | energy | content | output | permanent | crops | and | economic | farm | size

In | forested | areas | we | used | forest | harvesting | intensity | as | the | management | intensity | indicator | Forest | harvesting | intensity | was | measured | by | dividing | wood | felling | by | the | net | annual | increment | in | m | 3 | /ha | yr | Levers | et | al | 2014 | This | indicator | was | calculated | for | NUTS-0 | to | NUTS-3 | regions | depending | on | the | country | see | Levers | et | al | 2014 | for | details | This | indicator | was | also | normalized | to | score | between | zero | and | one

We | defined | landscape | structure | as | the | spatial | composition | and | heterogeneity | of | a | landscape | referring | to | the | spatial | relations | such | as | size | shape | and | configurations | of | the | individual | components | Turner | 1989 | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2016a | Since | the | composing | elements | of | a | landscape | dominated | by | forest | are | essentially | different | from | those | in | agricultural | landscapes | we | used | two | different | approaches | for | the | two | land | cover | classes

For | agricultural | land | arable | land | pasture | and | permanent | crops | we | used | field | size | and | the | abundance | of | green | linear | landscape | elements | Green | linear | elements | are | tree | lines | hedges | and | dry | stone | walls | indicating | the | degree | of | enclosedness | of | an | agricultural | landscape | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2013 | Abundance | of | green | linear | elements | and | enclosedness | are | often | valued | for | its | contribution | to | biodiversity | and | the | cultural | value | of | elements | such | as | stone | walls | and | hedgerows | Marshall | and | Moonen | 2002 | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2013 | For | the | EU27 | the | indicators | were | derived | from | the | Land | Use | Cover | Area | Frame | Survey | LUCAS | 2012 | microdatabase | EUROSTAT | 2012 | This | database | provides | over | 200,000 | point | observations | evenly | sampled | throughout | Europe | Gallego | and | Delincé | 2010 | Linear | elements | were | recorded | in | this | field | survey | using | a | 250 | m | transect | at | each | observation | point | We | interpolated | the | number | of | green | linear | elements | from | the | LUCAS | points | to | a | 1 | km | grid | using | Ordinary | Kriging | with | ArcGIS | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2013 | To | decrease | the | effects | of | outliers | we | capped | the | indicator | at | a | maximum | of | four | linear | elements | per | observation | point | and | subsequently | normalized | the | green | linear | elements | density | from | zero | low | density | to | one | high | density

Next | to | enclosedness | cultural | landscapes | are | often | associated | with | small | scale | agriculture | Van | Eetvelde | and | Antrop | 2004 | To | distinguish | small | scale | agriculture | from | industrial | agriculture | we | used | field | size | as | an | indicator | Field | size | is | also | recorded | in | the | LUCAS | survey | The | LUCAS | survey | records | the | size | of | the | field | in | which | each | observation | was | located | classified | into | four | categories | 0.5 | ha | 0.5 | 1 | ha | 1 | 10 | ha | and | 10 | ha | EUROSTAT | 2012 | We | reclassified | field | sizes | into | the | median | of | each | class | using | 15 | ha | for | the | largest | class | We | interpolated | the | results | to | the | 1 | km | grid | using | Ordinary | Kriging | and | normalized | the | field | size | indicator | from | zero | large | fields | to | one | small | fields | For | Switzerland | we | created | a | similar | pattern | of | observation | points | as | the | LUCAS | survey | and | mapped | A | joint | indicator | for | landscape | structure | was | calculated | as | the | average | score | of | the | normalized | green | linear | elements | and | field | size | indicators | High | values | on | this | indicator | for | agricultural | land | depict | those | landscapes | with | small | fields | and/or | many | green | linear | elements | Areas | with | small | fields | often | have | higher | abundance | of | green | linear | elements | the | two | layers | are | weakly | collinear | Pearson | 's | r | 0.29 | Since | small | fields | and | the | abundance | of | green | linear | elements | both | measure | structural | elements | of | cultural | landscapes | we | combined | the | two | into | one | dimension

Characterizing | the | landscape | structure | of | forest | requires | a | different | approach | Field | size | and | linear | elements | are | inappropriate | measures | for | the | characterization | of | forest | land | cover | European | wide | data | that | are | comparable | with | the | data | we | used | for | agricultural | lands | cover | is | scarce | As | landscape | structure | should | reveal | something | about | the | history | of | the | landscape | we | chose | to | map | forest | persistence | as | a | proxy | for | the | structure | of | forests | While | acknowledging | the | limitations | of | this | proxy | forest | structure | and | its | cultural | value | is | to | some | extent | related | to | its | persistence | or | length | of | the | period | that | the | forest | has | been | covering | the | area | The | forested | area | in | Europe | declined | due | to | anthropogenic | influences | until | the | 19th | century | In | the | twentieth | century | however | the | total | area | of | forest | increased | steadily | due | to | afforestation | nature | conservation | and | farmland | abandonment | Jepsen | et | al | 2015 | Pereira | et | al | 2010 | This | indicator | can | identify | relatively | new | forests | and | those | forests | that | have | been | present | for | at | least | a | century | a | proxy | for | the | more | traditional | forest | Here | we | assumed | that | more | persistent | forests | have | a | structure | that | can | be | considered | more | traditional | than | that | of | a | modern | forest | Fuchs | et | al | 2015 | composed | a | land | cover | map | for | each | decade | in | the | twentieth | century | on | a | 1 | km | grid | using | a | wide | set | of | old | Prussian | maps | and | modelling | techniques | Fuchs | et | al | 2015 | Using | these | maps | we | estimated | the | persistence | of | the | forests | ranging | from | zero | years | no | forest | in | 2000 | to | over | 110 | years | forest | land | cover | during | the | entire | period | 1900 | 2010 | The | more | persistent | the | forest | the | higher | the | score | on | the | structure | dimension

In | this | dimension | we | aimed | to | quantify | and | map | the | intangible | and | subjective | side | of | the | landscape | from | the | landscape | Landscape | value | and | meaning | are | well | studied | and | often | expressed | as | visual | preferences | Van | Zanten | et | al | 2014 | opportunities | for | recreation | Van | Berkel | and | Verburg | 2011 | or | sense | of | place | Hausmann | et | al | 2015 | A | recurring | insight | from | prior | work | is | that | often | landscape | values | and | meanings | are | related | to | landscape | structure | and | management | intensity | Nevertheless | they | can | not | be | assessed | in | mere | material | site | characteristics | Plieninger | et | al | 2015 | The | identification | of | value | and | meaning | should | therefore | rely | on | less | direct | proxies | than | the | operationalization | of | landscape | intensity | and | structure | to | capture | the | intangible | aspects | of | value | and | meaning | Paracchini | and | Capitani | 2011 | We | used | two | indicators | to | operationalize | this | dimension | of | our | cultural | landscape | typology

As | a | first | indicator | we | utilized | the | production | of | traditional | food | products | a | typical | form | of | cultural | heritage | which | can | be | linked | directly | to | the | landscape | it | is | produced | in | Bessière | 1998 | De | Roest | and | Menghi | 2000 | We | used | data | on | food | products | that | are | geographically | protected | by | EU | regulations | A | Protected | Designation | of | Origin | PDO | is | an | official | EU | certificate | that | requires | food | to | be | produced | according | to | certain | traditional | guidelines | within | a | bounded | geographical | area | Examples | of | PDO | protected | foodstuffs | are | Buffalo | Mozzarella | from | Campania | blue | cheese | from | Stilton | or | Prosciutto | from | Parma | Such | geographical | food | labels | can | provide | a | sense | of | place | to | tourists | Haven | Tang | and | Jones | 2005 | but | are | also | used | to | conserve | or | construct | a | local | identity | linked | to | the | landscape | Ilbery | et | al | 2005 | Following | Van | Berkel | and | Verburg | 2011 | we | mapped | all | PDOs | with | explicit | geographical | denomination | Special | wines | are | also | protected | with | the | PDO | sign | but | the | geographical | boundaries | of | grape | production | are | not | documented | and | PDOs | of | wines | were | therefore | excluded | Legal | documents | protecting | the | PDO | specify | either | an | administrative | region | or | a | number | of | places | where | the | relevant | product | can | be | made | When | the | geographical | denomination | was | a | list | of | villages | or | cities | instead | of | an | explicit | region | we | used | a | 5 | km | buffer | around | the | places | to | define | the | production | area | Van | Berkel | and | Verburg | 2011 | The | number | of | PDOs | per | region | varied | between | 0 | and | 12 | Very | few | regions | had | more | than | four | PDOs | therefore | we | capped | this | indicator | to | a | maximum | of | four | and | normalized | it | between | 0 | no | PDOs | to | 1 | many | PDOs

We | based | the | second | indicator | on | the | density | of | pictures | uploaded | on | Panoramio | a | Google | application | through | which | users | add | geotagged | landscape | pictures | to | Google | Earth | Social | media | data | and | other | crowdsourced | information | are | receiving | a | growing | interest | among | researchers | for | eliciting | landscape | values | Keeler | et | al | 2015 | Martínez | Pastur | et | al | 2015 | Richards | and | Friess | 2015 | Twitter | and | Instagram | have | already | been | harnessed | to | reveal | large | scale | behavior | patterns | of | people | Dunkel | 2015 | Frias | Martinez | et | al | 2012 | Wood | et | al | 2013 | A | recent | study | showed | that | Panoramio | photo | density | can | very | well | be | used | as | a | metric | for | aesthetic | enjoyment | and | outdoor | recreation | Van | Zanten | et | al | in | press | Over | 30 | million | pictures | have | been | added | to | Panoramio | in | the | last | six | years | in | Europe | only | and | the | database | is | growing | Although | a | good | overview | of | the | users | of | Panoramio | is | missing | the | density | of | photos | is | assumed | to | be | produced | by | both | locals | as | well | as | outsiders | Moreover | Panoramio | does | not | have | a | clear | bias | towards | certain | regions | in | Europe | in | contrast | to | other | platforms | such | as | Flickr | and | Instagram | Van | Zanten | et | al | in | press | We | downloaded | the | metadata | of | all | photos | including | X | and | Y | coordinates | with | a | geotag | in | Europe | through | the | Panoramio | REST | API | Panoramio | 2015 | For | this | purpose | we | developed | a | Python | script | that | sends | a | download | request | for | each | area | of | 0.01 | decimal | degrees | by | 0.01 | decimal | degrees | in | Europe | 1 | To | control | for | the | bias | of | very | active | users | we | calculated | the | number | of | unique | user | uploads | per | square | kilometer | as | an | indicator | for | the | societal | appreciation | of | European | landscapes | Photos | taken | in | urban | areas | were | excluded | based | on | the | land | cover | base | map | Section | 3.2 | After | filtering | urban | photos | and | accounting | for | unique | user | uploads | the | data | comprised | 4.6 | million | entries | We | normalized | the | data | to | score | the | 1 | km | grid | cells | using | the | natural | logarithm | of | the | number | of | photos | per | pixel | to | a | score | between | 0 | no | photos | to | 1 | many | photos | Data | were | downloaded | in | January | 2015 | Due | to | the | scarce | data | availability | we | limited | the | score | for | value | and | meaning | on | the | average | of | these | two | indicators | This | dimension | shows | one | aspect | of | the | supply | of | value | and | meaning | PDOs | as | well | as | the | demand | in | the | form | of | appreciation | by | people | However | we | are | aware | that | vital | concepts | such | as | sense | of | place | history | or | inspiration | are | not | included | in | the | indicators

Since | the | Cultural | Landscape | Index | CLI | of | agricultural | land | and | forests | relied | on | different | indicators | we | present | the | respective | CLIs | in | separate | maps | Fig | 1a | shows | the | spatial | distribution | of | overall | CLI | scores | in | agricultural | land | This | map | gives | a | rough | indication | of | coldspots | for | example | Northern | France | or | Eastern | Germany | and | hotspots | Tuscany | or | Lower | Normandy | of | cultural | landscapes | references | to | the | geographical | locations | are | localized | on | a | map | in | the | supplementary | material | More | generally | agricultural | land | with | high | CLIs | is | concentrated | around | the | Mediterranean | while | northern | countries | have | low | to | medium | CLIs | In | some | places | high | values | are | found | in | narrow | mountain | valleys | hardly | visible | in | the | maps | The | total | CLI | of | forests | in | Fig | 1b | shows | a | clear | pattern | high | CLIs | in | mountainous | areas | and | lower | scores | in | lowland | forests | An | exception | to | this | rule | can | be | found | in | Lapland | which | has | a | high | CLI | despite | the | dominance | of | lowland | forests

The | actual | characterization | based | on | the | dominant | dimension | is | shown | in | Fig | 2 | for | agricultural | land | Agricultural | land | in | Eastern | Europe | and | western | Spain | are | mostly | characterized | by | low | land | use | intensity | while | in | Ireland | and | Brittany | landscape | structure | is | the | dominant | dimension | Some | landscapes | frequently | occurring | in | the | Mediterranean | are | characterized | by | a | high | score | on | all | dimensions | dark | red | while | other | landscapes | such | as | in | eastern | Germany | and | northern | France | are | characterized | by | a | low | score | on | each | dimension | light | yellow | The | distribution | of | landscape | types | within | countries | show | striking | regional | patterns | Fig | 3 | Especially | in | Eastern | Europe | countries | have | a | similar | distribution | of | the | different | landscape | types | In | Switzerland | and | Luxemburg | significant | proportions | of | the | agricultural | area | score | low | on | the | dimensions | intensity | and | structure | but | still | provide | a | high | value | meaning | to | the | population | 1 | The | Python | script | is | available | upon | request

Opposite | patterns | high | scores | for | structure | and | intensity | but | low | value | meaning | are | seen | in | parts | of | Eastern | Europe | and | Portugal

Most | forest | in | mountainous | areas | is | characterized | by | high | values | on | all | three | dimensions | Fig | 4 | dark | red | We | found | persistent | but | intensively | harvested | forest | in | Scandinavia | and | in | small | patches | throughout | Europe | such | as | the | Landes | forest | France | southern | Germany | Austria | and | Czech | Republic | However | the | latter | three | examples | also | have | a | high | score | on | value | meaning

Our | sensitivity | analyses | Fig | 5a | and | b | indicate | to | what | extent | the | threshold | that | distinguishes | high | and | low | scores | for | each | dimension | influence | the | landscape | characterization | outcome | We | found | some | hotspots | of | agreement | indicating | low | sensitivity | to | thresholds | in | Ireland | northern | France | and | Romania | while | landscapes | such | as | the | Po | Valley | Western | Poland | or | the | valleys | in | Austria | have | only | 20%-40 | agreement | Areas | with | high | agreement | scores | can | be | regarded | as | areas | that | are | classified | with | high | certainty | as | belonging | to | the | category | it | is | given | in | Fig | 2 | Areas | with | a | low | agreement | scores | are | landscapes | that | with | small | adjustments | of | the | characterization | thresholds | are | categorized | into | a | different | landscape | type | For | forests | agreement | is | relatively | high | in | Scandinavia | and | mountainous | regions | while | it | is | lower | in | lowland | regions | especially | in | Germany | France | and | Poland | Large | forest | areas | such | as | in | Scandinavia | the | Landes | forest | and | mountainous | regions | tend | to | have | a | higher | agreement | score | while | smaller | forest | patches | tend | to | be | classified | with | a | lower | certainty

Cultural | landscapes | provide | important | ecosystem | services | harbor | farmland | biodiversity | and | are | cherished | for | their | heritage | throughout | the | world | Yet | cultural | landscapes | are | also | increasingly | threatened | by | intensification | on | the | one | hand | and | abandonment | on | the | other | While | cultural | landscapes | have | been | the | subject | of | many | studies | our | study | is | the | first | to | map | their | spatial | distribution | across | Europe | This | includes | an | overall | index | showing | the | correspondence | of | a | location | with | properties | commonly | associated | with | cultural | landscapes | Although | we | use | three | key | dimensions | of | cultural | landscapes | we | acknowledge | that | these | are | not | universal | We | provide | an | interactive | tool | where | individuals | can | view | use | and/or | customize | the | data | or | depict | landscapes | across | the | EU | in | different | ways | In | addition | we | characterize | the | dominant | dimensions | determining | this | index | and | the | sensitivity | of | this | characterization | towards | the | assumptions | made | Together | the | different | maps | allow | an | interpretation | of | the | diversity | of | conditions | that | characterize | cultural | landscapes | across | Europe

The | way | in | which | our | map | characterizes | well | known | cultural | landscapes | highlights | the | value | of | our | maps | A | good | example | of | a | well | known | cultural | landscape | is | found | in | Tuscany | Italy | Agnoletti | 2007 | which | is | clearly | distinguishable | in | our | three | maps | having | a | high | CLI | a | high | score | on | all | dimensions | and | a | relatively | high | agreement | score | Tuscany | is | home | to | many | PDOs | e.g. | pecorino | prosciutto | and | is | a | known | tourist | attraction | Moreover | a | hilly | terrain | and | soils | of | low | productivity | have | constrained | agricultural | intensification | which | has | led | to | the | persistence | of | the | traditional | farming | landscape | Agnoletti | 2007 | Similarly | the | bocage | landscapes | of | lower | Normandy | named | after | the | abundance | of | hedgerows | clearly | stand | out | on | all | our | three | maps | Due | to | a | change | from | collective | to | private | farming | many | hedgerows | were | planted | here | during | the | 18th | and | 19th | century | Unlike | many | other | areas | in | Europe | they | have | been | conserved | well | there | Bonnieux | and | Le | Goff | 1997 | Schulp | et | al | 2014 |  | In | contrast | large | parts | of | Eastern | Europe | are | characterized | by | a | low | score | on | the | structural | and | value | and | meaning | dimension | but | high | on | management | intensity | score | We | classified | 80 | 95 | of | the | landscapes | in | Eastern | Europe | as | large | scale | and/or | open | landscapes | Higher | scores | on | the | other | dimensions | here | are | found | in | mountainous | areas | that | are | often | managed | with | relatively | low | intensity | Rapid | institutional | and | political | transformations | during | the | 20th | century | caused | disruptive | changes | in | the | landscape | deteriorating | connections | once | held | between | inhabitants | and | their | landscape | Lieskovsk | ý | et | al | 2014 | Palang | et | al | 2006 | In | many | areas | in | Eastern | Europe | collectivization | during | the | Soviet | period | generated | large | fields | while | traditional | structures | such | as | linear | landscape | elements | were | largely | removed | during | that | period | Palang | 2010 | Moreover | the | protection | of | specialized | local | foodstuffs | is | not | very | common | in | Eastern | European | countries | leading | to | a | low | score | on | the | value | meaning | dimension | A | relatively | low |  | intensity | of | agricultural | management | is | a | common | feature | of | this | region | Partly | this | is | a | result | of | slower | intensification | Furthermore | after | 1989 | liberalization | caused | decreasing | agricultural | yields | that | triggered | widespread | dis | intensification | throughout | areas | east | of | the | former | Iron | Curtain | Kuemmerle | et | al | 2008 | Lieskovsk | ý | et | al | 2013 | with | fertilizer | input | dropped | by | more | than | 50 | in | a | number | of | eastern | and | central | European | countries | between | 1989 | and | 1999 | Macours | and | Swinnen | 2000 | This | explains | the | large | area | of | agricultural | land | primarily | characterized | by | low | management | intensity | In | spite | of | this | overall | pattern | many | hotspots | of | cultural | landscapes | are | still | found | in | eastern | and | central | Europe | Some | of | them | are | clearly | visible | in | our | characterization | for | example | in | the | south | of | Poland | or | the | south | of | Hungary | Palang | et | al | 2006 | Other | known | landscapes | such | as | those | in | Romania | are | of | great | ecological | and | cultural | value | Sutcliffe | et | al | 2013 | but | appear | less | clearly | in | our | characterization

A | similar | landscape | type | with | low | scores | on | the | structure | dimension | and | high | scores | on | the | intensity | dimension | can | also | be | found | in | southern | Spain | and | Portugal | These | dehesa | Spain | or | montando | Portugal | landscapes | are | generally | regarded | as | a | traditional | landscape | of | high | cultural | significance | Spain | has | faced | less | disruptive | political | changes | with | expansive | impact | on | land | management | than | took | place | in | Eastern | Europe | though | these | landscapes | were | subject | to | severe | but | more | gradual | changes | as | well | The | dehesas | today | are | largely | found | in | those | landscape | less | suitable | for | intensive | agriculture | Vicente | and | Alés | 2006 | Today | this | silvo | pastoral | landscape | system | of | the | dehesa | montando | where | animals | graze | within | cleared | oak | forests | Plieninger | et | al | 2003 | is | characteristic | for | Southwestern | Spain | and | Southeastern | Portugal | and | is | mainly | used | for | non | timber | forest | products | and | meat | production | Campos | et | al | 2013 | Moreover | the | typical | Iberian | ham | which | is | protected | with | multiple | PDOs | is | the | main | economic | raison | d'être | for | the | maintenance | of | this | landscape | type | Zimmermann | 2006

The | agreement | in | the | forests | classified | with | high | scores | on | all | dimensions | in | mountains | such | as | the | Alps | the | Pyrenees | or | the | Carpathians | is | remarkably | high | These | forests | have | persisted | over | the | last | century | they | show | a | relatively | low | harvesting | intensity | and | they | are | displayed | prominently | on | Panoramio | photos | Therefore | these | forests | also | have | a | high | CLI | and | have | high | scores | on | all | dimensions | Other | forest | landscapes | known | for | its | cultural | significance | such | as | the | Black | Forest | in | southern | Germany | Plieninger | and | Bieling | 2012 | appear | as | persistent | and | with | value | or | meaning | These | forests | which | are | more | accessible | than | mountainous | forests | are | more | intensely | harvested | than | the | less | accessible | mountain | forests | Other | forest | landscapes | which | also | show | persistence | but | not | characterized | with | value | and | meaning | are | mainly | found | in | Finland | and | Sweden | and | for | instance | in | the | Landes | forest | These | locations | show | resemblance | with | the | even | aged | production | forests | in | the | typology | of | Hengeveld | et | al | 2012

Other | forests | not | characterized | by | persistence | are | more | scattered | throughout | Europe | and | are | largely | found | in | lowland | regions

Here | afforestation | occurred | after | the | Second | World | War | Forests | were | both | needed | to | meet | increased | wood | demand | and | a | desire | for | timber | self | sufficiency | Vilén | et | al | 2012 | and | also | followed | contraction | of | agricultural | land | upon | intensification | Nabuurs | et | al | 2003 | Consequently | countries | with | a | low | score | on | the | three | dimensions | in | agricultural | areas | due | to | intensification | also | tend | to | have | low | scores | in | forests | Although | not | very | stark | these | relatively | new | forests | do | show | some | spatial | overlap | with | regions | of | land | abandonment | Estel | et | al | 2015 | such | as | in | eastern | Poland

Providing | a | characterization | of | cultural | landscapes | in | Europe | is | a | challenging | task | as | there | is | no | consensus | on | defining | and | characterizing | cultural | landscapes | Simply | mapping | the | diversity | of | landscapes | in | terms | of | composition | or | farming | practices | is | insufficient | to | map | the | variety | of | cultural | value | of | these | landscapes | We | incorporated | human | activities | through | the | intensity | dimension | and | appreciation | though | the | value | and | meaning | dimension | By | adding | the | value | and | meaning | dimension | we | tried | to | incorporate | the | subjective | and | intangible | aspect | of | the | landscape | as | described | by | Jones | 1991 | However | we | are | aware | of | the | fact | that | especially | these | indicators | are | all | but | comprehensive | but | nevertheless | give | a | reasonable | indication | of | the | dimension | given | the | available | data | Concepts | that | are | still | missing | from | this | typology | are | amongst | others | local | history | or | the | different | value | to | different | peoples | Our | overall | cultural | landscapes | index | is | an | expression | of | how | close | these | landscapes | come | to | the | −simplified | ideal | of | a | cultural | landscape | as | found | back | in | much | of | the | literature | on | cultural | landscapes | defined | by | a | rich | landscape | structure | low | land | use | intensity | and | high | values | and | meanings | At | the | same | time | we | acknowledge | that | ordinary | or | everyday | landscapes | that | score | low | in | all | three | dimensions | e.g. | many | peri | urban | landscapes | of | Central | Europe | are | of | importance | for | people | 's | quality | of | life | as | well | as | recognized | in | the | European | Landscape | Convention | Conrad | et | al | 2011 | The | CLI | map | should | therefore | be | treated | with | caution | and | should | not | be | interpreted | as | a | valuation | of | landscapes | The | classification | proposed | should | be | interpreted | as | a | characterization | of | landscape | rather | than | a | valuation | A | higher | score | on | the | cultural | landscape | index | therefore | does | not | imply | more | value | it | implies | greater | correspondence | to | what | is | commonly | denoted | as | a | traditional | cultural | landscape

Irrespective | of | the | methodology | chosen | the | data | selection | is | a | source | of | uncertainty | as | different | indicators | may | lead | to | different | cultural | landscape | characterizations | Cultural | heritage | may | not | be | directly | visible | in | a | physical | landscape | Quintessential | aspects | of | cultural | value | and | meaning | or | heritage | are | not | fully | captured | in | this | analysis | mainly | due | to | the | fact | that | there | are | no | data | that | can | be | used | for | a | wall | to | wall | European | assessment | We | confined | ourselves | to | including | the | three | dimensions | of | cultural | landscapes | commonly | agreed | upon | in | the | literature | but | we | provided | the | option | to | customize | the | characterization | on | the | Hercules | Knowledge | Hub | http://labs.kh.hercules-landscapes.eu/landscape | typologies.html | to | allow | other | users | to | adjust | the | characterization | to | their | needs

In | contrast | to | the | general | notion | of | landscapes | being | composed | of | multiple | land | cover | types | we | chose | to | separate | forests | from | agricultural | landscapes | in | this | study | since | the | data | were | significantly | different | for | these | two | broad | lands | cover | classes | Therefore | some | of | the | integrity | of | landscapes | as | mosaics | of | agriculture | and | forest | often | expressed | at | resolutions | below | the | one | used | in | this | study | are | not | captured

The | data | layers | for | the | intensity | and | structure | are | all | derived | from | well | established | datasets | that | were | previously | used | in | several | European | scale | studies | Overmars | et | al | 2014 | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2016a | Van | der | Zanden | et | al | 2013 | .The | only | dataset | that | was | created | particularly | for | this | study | is | the | Panoramio | photo | density | The | usage | of | social | media | and | big | data | for | the | purpose | of | approximating | landscape | preferences | is | not | entirely | new | Casalegno | et | al | 2013 | but | a | European | wide | photo | density | map | never | has | been | produced | for | this | purpose | The | map | reveals | some | interesting | patterns | and | strongly | suggests | preferences | for | certain | type | of | landscapes | such | as | a | clear | preference | for | mountainous | areas | and | landscapes | close | to | water | bodies | As | the | high | density | of | photos | along | the | Camino | de | Santiago | shows | care | should | be | taken | in | interpretation | as | result | of | the | potential | biases | related | to | these | data | Panoramio | only | shows | where | users | have | taken | photos | and | subsequently | uploaded | them | on | the | web | Social | media | users | are | by | no | means | representative | for | the | entire | population | Boyd | and | Crawford | 2012 | However | the | combination | of | Panoramio | with | the | PDO | data | reduced | potential | biases | With | current | trends | in | big | data | research | and | the | use | of | crowd | sourced | information | for | landscape | preference | and | valuation | Dunkel | Goossen | 2010 | Wood | et | al | 2013 | the | data | used | in | the | characterization | could | be | improved | to | include | different | aspects | of | cultural | landscapes

In | this | study | we | used | three | dimensions | of | cultural | landscapes | commonly | identified | as | important | Plieninger | et | al | 2015 | in | order | to | map | cultural | landscapes | on | the | European | scale | By | using | these | dimensions | we | were | able | to | identify | known | hotpots | of | cultural | landscapes | such | as | Tuscany | the | Dehesas | or | the | bocage | in | Normandy | less | known | hotspots | such | as | mountainous | forests | or | coldspots | of | cultural | landscapes | such | as | the | landscapes | of | industrial | agriculture | northern | France | High | scores | on | all | three | dimensions | were | mainly | found | in | southern | European | countries | and | in | local | hotspots | elsewhere | such | as | southeastern | Poland | Landscapes | with | lower | scores | on | at | least | two | of | the | three | dimensions | were | found | in | Northern | France | Eastern | Germany | Bulgaria | and | Romania | Furthermore | the | characterization | proposed | in | this | paper | can | be | used | as | a | framework | for | local | or | regional | case | studies | By | doing | so | this | paper | addresses | the | aims | of | the | European | Landscape | Convention | to | promote | landscape | protection | management | and | planning | and | to | organize | European | co | operation | on | landscape | issues | Council | of | Europe | 2000 | Our | map | of | cultural | landscapes | includes | the | first | characterization | including | proxies | to | measure | people | 's | perception | This | may | enhance | the | protection | of | valuable | cultural | landscape | while | it | simultaneously | caters | for | European | co | operation | as | similarities | between | landscapes | across | borders | become | apparent

Our | characterization | can | also | be | used | to | monitor | change | in | cultural | landscapes | Most | cultural | landscapes | face | severe | threats | due | to | both | intensification | and | extreme | de | intensification | or | abandonment | By | updating | this | characterization | with | regular | time | intervals | it | becomes | a | monitor | for | the | current | status | of | the | different | cultural | landscapes | of | Europe | since | it | especially | focusses | on | the | management | of | the | landscapes | This | creates | a | framework | to | identify | and | classify | threats | and | opportunities | to | and | for | cultural | landscapes | throughout | Europe
