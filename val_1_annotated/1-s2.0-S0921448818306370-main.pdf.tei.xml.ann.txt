This | article | analyses | the | cost | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | on | dairy | sheep | farms | located | in | Grosseto | Italy | Farmers | profits | have | recently | declined | due | to | a | stable | product | price | but | increasing | production | costs | Animal | diseases | have | a | cascade | of | effects | on | farm | productivity | Lamb | enteric | disease | outbreaks | which | result | in | mortality | in | the | herd | and | reduced | weight | gain | can | drastically | compromise | the | income | of | farmers | An | economic | analysis | of | the | impact | of | an | outbreak | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | was | thus | performed | evaluating | the | cost | of | disease | based | on | the | main | visible | production | losses | such | as | mortality | reduced | weight | gain | and | variation | in | milk | production | A | sensitivity | analysis | was | also | conducted | by | applying | different | observed | ranges | of | prevalence | and | mortality | associated | with | the | disease | Finally | an | economic | scenario | analysis | was | performed | considering | different | in | farm | management | options | for | delivering | lambs | to | the | abattoir | i.e. | early | standard | and | late | delivery | The | results | showed | that | a | dairy | sheep | farm | with | around | 300 | lambs | that | delivers | them | to | the | abattoir | at | 30 | days | of | age | would | experience | a | loss | of | between | 50 | and | 1200 | Euro | during | an | outbreak | of | diarrhoea | with | a | prevalence | of | 34.21 | 23.54 | 44.88)% | and | a | mortality | of | 15.69 | 9.98 | 21.4)%

Sheep | farming | plays | a | very | important | economic | social | and | environmental | role | in | the | Mediterranean | region | Finocchiaro | et | al | 2005 | Ripoll | Bosch | et | al | 2012 | Besides | its | primary | function | of | producing | dairy | products | and | meat | sheep | farming | is | strongly | embedded | in | the | culture | and | traditions | of | the | area | Boyazoglu | and | Morand | Fehr | 2001 | In | Italy | despite | a | general | trend | for | intensification | aimed | at | increasing | animal | productivity | sheep | farming | is | becoming | less | and | less | profitable | with | many | farms | at | risk | of | economic | marginalization | De | Rancourt | et | al | 2006 | Idda | et | al | 2010 | In | this | multifactorial | scenario | technical | and | managerial | aspects | of | sheep | farming | are | increasingly | fundamental | as | they | can | play | a | decisive | role | in | its | competitiveness

According | to | Rushton | 2009 | a | change | in | animal | disease | status | will | have | an | impact | on | farm | productivity | which | is | defined | as | the | efficiency | of | the | conversion | of | inputs | into | outputs | and | consequently | can | produce | multiple | negative | effects | Howe | et | al | 2013 | Otte | and | Chilonda | 2000 | Rushton | 2009 | The | impacts | of | diseases | on | animal | productivity | are | generally | classified | as | direct | or | indirect | Direct | impacts | can | be | classified | as | visible | or | invisible | whereas | indirect | impacts | can | be | coded | as | additional | costs | and | missed | revenue | Otte | and | Chilonda | 2000 | Knight | Jones | and | Rushton | 2013 | Oseguera | Montiel | et | al | 2015

As | observed | by | El | Tahawy | 2010 | diarrhoea | is | one | of | the | most | common | and | costly | diseases | affecting | sheep | due | to | its | effects | on | small | neonatal | individuals | and | can | account | for | up | to | 46 | of | total | lamb | mortality | Schoenian | 2008 | Although | the | importance | of | the | economic | losses | related | to | neonatal | diarrhoea | in | lambs | has | been | considered | by | other | authors | Gökçe | and | Erdoğan | 2009 | Nasr | et | al | 2014 | literature | and | data | on | the | economic | impact | of | this | syndrome | are | lacking | Lambs | affected | by | diarrhoea | develop | watery | faeces | reduced | body | weight | and | in | severe | cases | death | occurs | Thus | outbreaks | of | enteric | disease | in | lambs | can | compromise | farmers | yield | In | addition | control | measures | can | be | difficult | to | apply | depending | on | the | specific | farm | characteristics | and | the | kind | of | pathogens | involved | Thus | the | aim | of | this | study | was | to | analyse | based | on | empirical | observations | the | costs | of | lamb | diarrhoea | on | sheep | farms | in | the | province | of | Grosseto | Italy | The | analysis | should | help | farmers | and | veterinarians | to | understand | and | calculate | the | costs | for | their | farms | and | to | plan | economically | efficient | control | strategies

The | study | was | performed | during | the | period | October | 2013 | to | September | 2015 | Data | collection | was | implemented | in | a | passive | way | by | targeting | farms | declaring | an | outbreak | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | to | the | local | VPH | laboratory | IZSLT | in | the | province | of | Grosseto | Data | were | collected | by | interviewing | 33 | farms | 82 | out | of | a | total | of | 41 | farms | that | reported | outbreaks | of | diarrhoea | in | the | period | of | observation | using | an | ad | hoc | questionnaire | The | data | analysis | was | performed | in | Excel | Demographic | data | were | analysed | to | identify | the | characteristics | of | the | sample | Managerial | data | were | analysed | to | identify | the | main | strategies | of | management | during | outbreaks | which | included | the | time | of | delivery | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | Epidemiological | data | were | analysed | to | identify | the | prevalence | and | mortality | during | the | reported | outbreaks | of | diarrhoea | Finally | economic | data | were | analysed | to | identify | the | main | costs | of | the | outbreak | in | the | sample | Costs | were | estimated | by | considering | the | main | visible | production | losses | such | as | mortality | reduced | daily | weight | gain | and | variation | in | milk | production | through | a | partial | budget | analysis | This | type | of | analysis | evaluates | the | economic | change | associated | with | the | disease | without | considering | fixed | costs | Morris | 1999 | A | sensitivity | analysis | based | on | empirical | data | collected | in | the | field | was | also | applied | by | varying | the | prevalence | and | mortality | associated | with | the | disease | Finally | an | economic | scenario | analysis | based | on | the | different | times | of | delivery | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | was | performed | to | evaluate | three | possible | in | farm | management | options | in | the | case | of | diarrhoea | outbreak | 1 | early | delivery | 2 | standard | delivery | and | 3 | late | delivery | The | sensitivity | analysis | was | based | on | an | average | sheep | farm | n | of | lambs | 316 | with | an | in | farm | prevalence | of | diarrhoea | p | of | 34.21 | 23.54 | 44.88 | and | a | mortality | R | m | of | 15.69 | 9.98 | 21.4)% | For | the | purpose | of | quantifying | the | losses | experienced | in | the | study | population | the | prices | considered | were | consistent | with | those | officially | paid | to | the | farms | for | their | products | i.e. | milk | and | meat | and | reported | by | ISMEA | for | December | 2014 | ISMEA | 2014 | i.e. | 4.2 | /Kg | for | lamb | meat | and | 0.92 | /litre | for | Tuscan | sheep | milk

The | study | was | carried | out | in | Grosseto | a | province | located | in | Tuscany | the | second | most | important | Italian | region | for | sheep | milk | production | ISTAT | 2014 | Grosseto | which | extends | over | 4503 | Km | 2 | ISTAT | 2013 | is | home | to | about | 220,000 | sheep | distributed | among | 1200 | farms | devoted | mainly | to | milk | production | using | a | semi | extensive | system | Anagrafe | Nazionale | Zootecnica | 2016 | Idda | et | al | 2010 | The | predominant | breed | in | this | region | is | the | Sarda | sheep | a | highly | adaptable | breed | with | a | milk | yield | that | influences | importantly | the | cash | surplus | of | farmers | Natale | et | al | 2000 | The | average | milk | production | net | of | lamb | suckled | milk | varies | from | 60 | to | 130 | litres | in | 100 | days | for | yearlings | from | 90 | to | 170 | litres | in | 180 | days | for | ewes | after | their | second | pregnancy | and | from | 100 | to | 180 | litres | in | 180 | days | in | mature | ewes | According | to | the | ASSONAPA | breed | standards | the | average | age | of | first | lambing | of | ewes | is | 15 | months | Lambing | occurs | mainly | in | November | December | in | adult | ewes | and | in | January | March | in | ewe | lambs | Natale | et | al | 2000 | Meat | production | derives | mainly | from | suckling | lambs | usually | slaughtered | at | 30 | days | old | with | an | average | weight | as | reported | in | Table | 1 | Carta | et | al | 1995 | ASSONAPA | 1987

When | an | outbreak | of | diarrhoea | occurs | in | lambs | some | of | the | affected | lambs | will | recover | and | some | of | them | will | die | usually | as | a | consequence | of | dehydration | Fig | 1 | Affected | farms | will | require | extra | labour | to | manage | the | disease | and | will | see | an | increase | in | veterinary | costs | due | either | to | visits | by | the | veterinarians | or | to | treatment | of | the | disease

Affected | lambs | will | have | a | reduced | average | daily | weight | gain | ADG | Farmers | have | to | choose | between | keeping | the | lambs | on | the | farm | for | longer | in | order | to | achieve | the | usual | selling | weight | or | selling | any | recovered | lambs | regardless | of | their | weight | without | waiting | any | longer | than | usual | In | the | first | case | the | lambs | will | reach | the | ideal | weight | for | selling | by | continuing | consuming | milk | from | their | mothers | thus | reducing | the | amount | of | milk | available | for | sale | In | the | second | case | lambs | will | be | sold | at | a | lower | weight | than | usual | thus | reducing | the | revenue | from | meat | while | milk | will | be | available | for | the | market

The | total | loss | of | meat | from | a | farm | Total | L | meat | Eq | 1 | has | been | estimated | as | a | function | of | the | loss | due | to | the | mortality | of | lambs | L | m | and | the | loss | in | weight | L | w | due | to | the | reduced | weight | of | lambs | affected | by | diarrhoea | at | the | end | of | the | productive | cycle | i.e. | 30 | days

Both | L | m | Eq | 1 | and | L | w | Eq | 1 | are | functions | of | the | number | of | lambs | born | N | l | the | prevalence | of | diarrhoea | on | the | farm | p | the | mortality | of | the | lambs | during | the | outbreak | m | the | weight | of | the | lambs | at | the | day | of | delivery | to | the | abattoir | W | h | weight | of | healthy | lamb | or | W | d | weight | of | lamb | with | diarrhoea | and | the | price | of | lamb | meat | P | lm | Thus | the | total | loss | of | meat | expressed | in | Euro | can | be | calculated | as | in | Eq | 2

2 | which | can | also | be | expressed | as

The | weight | of | lambs | with | diarrhoea | W | d | at | 30 | days | was | estimated | to | be | 8 | Kg | as | previously | found | by | Aloisio | et | al | 2006 | while | the | potential | weight | of | healthy | lambs | W | h | was | calculated | in | Eq | 4 | as | the | average | weight | considering | the | standard | data | for | the | Sarda | breed | at | 30 | days | Table | 1 | a | rate | of | twins | of | 25 | T | t | and | the | probability | of | having | a | male | or | female | as | 50 | ASSONAPA | 1987

During | diarrhoea | outbreaks | the | mortality | of | lambs | also | influences | the | farm | milk | yield | as | an | average | of | 1 | L | of | milk | is | consumed | per | lamb | each | day | Thus | the | total | milk | production | M | Δ | gain | of | the | farm | can | estimated | as | in | Eq | 5 | d | is | the | number | of | days | when | 1 | L | of | milk | is | given | to | the | lamb | This | last | can | range | from | 29 | if | the | lamb | dies | on | the | first | day | to | 0 | if | the | lamb | is | delivered | to | the | abattoir | at | the | end | of | the | estimated | productive | cycle | 30 | days | In | this | case | no | milk | is | further | saved | for | sale | during | the | 30 | day | rearing | period

Consequently | the | total | amount | of | income | lost | Total | L | Eq | 6 | can | be | calculated | as | the | sum | of | total | meat | loss | Total | L | meat | and | the | total | milk | production | gain | M | Δ | due | to | the | death | of | lambs

Finally | a | sensitivity | analysis | was | performed | by | applying | the | observed | ranges | of | prevalence | and | mortality | associated | with | the | disease | on | a | farm | with | 316 | lambs | mean | number | of | lambs | in | the | sample

An | analysis | of | different | management | scenarios | regarding | the | time | of | delivery | animals | to | the | abattoir | was | performed | Three | different | scenarios | were | analysed | early | 20 | days | standard | 30 | days | and | late | delivery | The | date | of | late | delivery | was | established | by | calculating | the | day | on | which | lambs | with | diarrhoea | would | reach | the | ideal | weight | 10 | kg | In | order | to | evaluate | the | weight | of | the | lambs | at | different | times | the | average | daily | weight | gain | of | healthy | lambs | ADG | h | Eq | 7 | and | lambs | with | diarrhoea | ADG | d | Eq | 8 | was | calculated | based | on | an | average | weight | at | birth | W | b | equal | to | 3.5 | kg | ASSONAPA | 1987 |  | 8)

In | the | case | of | early | delivery | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | the | reduction | in | income | from | meat | yield | would | be | compensated | for | by | an | increase | in | milk | yield | while | in | the | case | of | late | delivery | losses | in | milk | production | due | to | suckling | lambs | would | be | incurred

The | farmers | in | the | study | population | confirmed | that | the | majority | of | the | sheep | raised | in | the | region | are | Sarda | sheep | 88.24 | The | flocks | were | composed | of | an | average | of | 445 | sheep | farm | with | 44 | of | the | farms | having | an | average | of | 300 | 500 | sheep | farm | Seventy | three | percent | of | farms | were | managed | exclusively | by | family | members | with | an | average | manpower | of | 2.2 | people | farm | Just | over | 73 | of | managers | had | received | education | up | to | middle | school | level | The | income | of | the | farms | is | mainly | based | on | milk | and | meat | yields | A | few | farms | also | had | an | income | from | farming | other | animals | 29.41 | vegetable | fruit | production | 20.56 | forage | production | for | market | 11.76 | and | production | of | alternative | energy | 8.82

After | balancing | the | losses | of | meat | production | due | to | mortality | and | the | reduced | weight | gain | with | the | variation | increase | in | milk | yield | in | the | case | of | lamb | mortality | the | in | farm | production | losses | during | an | outbreak | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | fluctuated | from | 50 | to | 1200 | Euro | Fig | 2 | for | the | average | farm | n | of | lambs | 316 | with | a | prevalence | of | diarrhoea | of | 34.21 | 23.54 | 44.88 | a | mortality | of | 15.69 | 9.98 | 21.4 | and | standard | delivery | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | at | 30 | days | If | we | consider | the | maximum | mortality | 80 | recorded | by | one | of | the | observed | farms | economic | losses | due | to | an | outbreak | of | diarrhoea | may | reach | up | to | 2500 | Euro

3.2.1 | Variation | in | total | estimated | economic | losses | according | to | the | day | of | delivery | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | Fig | 3 | shows | the | economic | losses | per | diseased | Sarda | lamb | in | relation | to | the | day | of | abattoir | delivery | from | 20 | to | 42 | days | considering | the | difference | in | milk | yield | versus | standard | delivery | 30 | days | The | early | and | late | options | for | delivering | animals | to | the | abattoir | were | considered | respectively | as | 20 | and | 42 | days | based | on | an | average | daily | growth | rate | of | diseased | lambs | ADG | d | of | 0.15 | kg | head | Eq | 8) | Thus | theoretically | an | average | lamb | with | diarrhoea | will | reach | 6.5 | kg | at | 20 | days | and | the | 30day | old | healthy | lamb | 's | weight | x | 9.85 | Kg | at | 42 | days | Although | the | economic | losses | from | meat | will | be | nil | on | the | 42nd | day | an | overall | economic | loss | will | be | incurred | due | to | the | reduced | amount | of | milk | sold | which | was | instead | used | to | feed | the | lambs | Fig | 3

In | this | study | we | provide | evidence | of | the | economic | losses | due | to | potential | loss | of | production | during | a | diarrhoea | outbreak | in | lambs | The | production | losses | such | as | lamb | mortality | balanced | by | increased | milk | sales | and | low | lamb | weight | can | vary | between | 50 | and | 1200 | Euro | Fig | 2 | for | the | average | farm | n | lambs | 316 | within | the | observed | range | of | prevalence | p | 34.21 | 23.54 | 44.88 | and | mortality | Rm | 15.69 | 9.98 | 21.4)% | from | diarrhoea | in | the | Grosseto | territory | reaching | up | to | 2500 | Euro | in | the | extreme | event | of | 80 | mortality | The | estimated | drop | in | production | may | be | very | important | given | that | the | net | farm | income | for | Tuscany | 's | sheep | and | goat | farming | system | may | be | around | 11,000 | Euro | as | calculated | for | 2013 | by | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | European | Commission | 2016

This | estimation | is | based | on | the | ideal | delivery | to | abattoir | on | the | 30th | day | of | age | Simulations | were | performed | in | relation | to | the | different | management | options | related | to | the | time | of | delivery | of | animals | to | the | abattoir | early | standard | or | delayed | during | diarrhoea | outbreaks | In | the | study | area | two | different | management | options | were | available | in | this | regard | Our | analysis | shows | that | in | a | standard | setting | it | is | economically | preferable | to | bring | forward | the | delivery | of | the | lambs | to | the | abattoir | to | 20 | days | of | age | rather | than | waiting | for | the | lambs | to | recover | the | ideal | weight | at | 42 | days | This | can | be | attributed | to | the | high | economic | impact | of | milk | yield | in | the | study | area

Of | course | the | estimates | in | this | study | are | only | indicative | as | the | reality | may | differ | depending | on | the | cause | of | diarrhoea | and | the | different | sanitary | measures | and | treatments | that | could | be | applied | The | different | management | options | during | diarrhoea | outbreaks | such | as | more | frequent | cleaning | operations | and | pharmacological | treatment | of | sick | animals | will | increase | the | costs | associated | with | the | outbreaks | Such | data | were | not | considered | in | this | study | since | as | diarrhoea | is | a | multifactorial | disease | costs | can | differ | from | pathogen | to | pathogen | and | from | one | management | option | to | another | In | addition | it | is | worth | remembering | that | the | day | of | delivery | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | may | vary | following | treatment | depending | on | the | drugs | used | Furthermore | the | day | of | mortality | as | well | as | the | day | of | delivery | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | should | be | considered | only | as | an | indicative | average | day | as | there | is | no | fixed | day | for | lambing | in | a | flock | or | for | lambs | getting | the | disease | and | furthermore | lambs | are | delivered | to | abattoirs | in | batches | and | not | individually | It | would | also | be | important | to | remember | that | these | estimations | were | Finally | it | is | worth | noting | that | to | avoid | the | economic | losses | associated | with | diarrhoea | outbreaks | prophylaxis | of | diarrhoea | should | be | implemented | as | well | as | fast | and | reliable | diagnosis | in | order | to | control | the | spread | of | the | disease | In | this | regard | it | would | be | appropriate | to | have | an | in | farm | sanitary | plan | to | prevent | and | manage | diseases | Today | the | European | trend | is | to | demand | the | sanitary | plans | for | disease | prevention | and | control | to | the | farmers | who | became | the | first | responsible | for | their | implementation | Umali | et | al | 1994 | Ahuja | 2004 | Castillo | Salgado | 2010 | In | our | project | the | majority | of | the | farms | were | small | family | enterprises | with | a | middle | school | level | of | education | 73 | In | this | context | there | is | often | insufficient | scientific | knowledge | and | economic | opportunity | for | the | implementation | of | sanitary | plans | and | thus | it | is | important | to | provide | public | veterinary | support | This | would | help | foster | not | only | the | economic | benefits | of | the | traditional | rural | production | system | but | would | also | help | control | the | spreading | of | zoonoses | that | are | often | associated | with | diarrhoea | in | lambs | e.g. | cryptosporidiosis | giardia | salmonella

This | study | confirms | the | high | impact | that | outbreaks | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | can | have | on | the | profitability | of | sheep | farms | The | drop | in | production | due | to | low | lamb | weight | and | lamb | mortality | balanced | by | milk | production | may | vary | between | 50 | and | 1200 | Euro | considering | an | average | farm | with | 316 | lambs | a | prevalence | of | diarrhoea | of | 34.21 | 23.54 | 44.88)% | and | a | mortality | of | 15.69 | 9.98 | 21.4)% | and | standard | delivery | to | abattoir | reaching | up | to | 2500 | Euro | in | the | extreme | event | of | 80 | mortality | This | drop | in | production | may | be | very | important | for | farmers | as | their | net | income | was | calculated | by | the | FADNS | in | 2013 | as | being | around | 11,000 | Euro | European | Commission | 2016

Early | delivery | e.g. | 20 | days | of | age | of | lambs | to | the | abattoir | would | be | economically | beneficial | compared | to | late | delivery | e.g. | 42 | days | of | age | after | waiting | for | the | sick | lambs | to | gain | the | weight | expected | at | 30 | days | of | age | due | to | the | increased | income | from | milk | production | once | the | lambs | are | slaughtered | These | data | are | only | indicative | as | the | reality | may | be | different | due | to | the | type | of | pathogen | and | different | sanitary | approaches | but | are | useful | for | understanding | the | economic | effect | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | a | disease | that | is | often | underestimated | by | farmers | Understanding | the | cost | of | a | diarrhoea | outbreak | may | be | useful | to | promote | the | use | of | proper | prophylaxis | fast | diagnosis | and | correct | management | of | such | outbreaks

Finally | these | results | provide | a | useful | starting | point | to | avoid | underestimating | the | importance | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | given | its | important | negative | economic | effects | The | economic | losses | due | to | lamb | diarrhoea | in | a | small | production | system | such | as | the | sheep | dairy | system | in | Grosseto | analysed | in | this | paper | are | extremely | important | due | to | the | currently | increasing | production | costs | and | the | stagnancy | of | the | products | prices | which | are | already | compromising | the | profitability | of | this | farming | system | Indeed | despite | the | relatively | low | productivity | of | the | sheep | dairy | system | observed | in | this | case | study | it | has | both | high | environmental | and | social | importance | in | Grosseto | This | sheep | farming | system | is | located | in | a | rural | area | that | is | unsuitable | for | other | types | of | farming | and | plays | a | very | important | role | in | the | maintenance | of | tradition | and | environment | Keeping | this | small | farming | system | healthy | will | help | to | generate | positive | Fig | 2 | Economic | losses | of | the | average | farm | with | a | prevalence | of | diarrhoea | in | lambs | of | 34.21 | 23.54 | 44.88 | and | a | mortality | rate | ranging | within | the | confidence | limit | of | 95 | CL | 9.98 | 21.40 | social | and | environmental | effects | that | should | not | be | valued | only | in | monetary | terms | Morris | 2009
