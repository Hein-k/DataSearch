The | purpose | of | this | paper | is | to | analyse | under | what | conditions | with | respect | to | CO | 2 | emission | reduction | and | biofuels | for | transport | targets | the | trading | in | the | EU | of | CO | 2 | credits | and | solid | and/or | liquid | biofuels | is | cost | effective | from | the | perspective | of | an | optimisation | energy | systems | model | We | use | the | PEEP | model | covering | the | EU27 | except | Bulgaria | Malta | and | Cyprus | to | generate | insights | about | the | cost | effectiveness | of | different | options | under | different | policy | scenarios | Trade | in | CO | 2 | credits | is | a | cost | effective | option | in | all | relevant | policy | scenarios | Trade | in | some | biofuels | mainly | from | central | and | eastern | European | countries | to | the | EU15 | is | cost | effective | in | all | assessed | scenarios | In | the | case | of | CO | 2 | targets | whether | national | or | at | the | EU | level | there | is | trade | in | solid | biofuels | When | biofuels | for | transport | targets | are | also | implemented | trading | both | solid | and | liquid | biofuels | is | cost | effective

Bioenergy | has | the | potential | to | mitigate | climate | change | In | the | European | Union | EU | increased | bioenergy | use | is | promoted | through | targets | and | measures | favouring | bioenergy | over | fossil | fuel | based | energy | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | Biomass | supply | potential | and | present | use | of | bioenergy | differ | considerably | among | EU25 | member | states | MS | 5 | 6 | The | bioenergy | potential | in | central | and | eastern | European | countries | CEEC | has | been | estimated | to | be | substantial | compared | with | prospective | domestic | demand | and | the | production | cost | is | estimated | to | be | lower | than | in | western | European | countries | 7 | 8 | Increasing | intra | European | bioenergy | trade | has | been | proposed | in | order | to | realise | the | EU25 | bioenergy | potential | 6 | 7 | The | demand | for | costeffective | carbon | dioxide | CO | 2 | emissions | reductions | can | be | considered | a | general | rationale | for | bioenergy | trade | in | addition | to | supply | and | cost | differentials | Studies | also | indicate | that | the | climate | benefit | of | substituting | biomass | for | fossil | fuels | for | energy | purposes | is | retained | even | if | the | biomass | is | transported | long | distances | 9 | 10

Emitting | CO | 2 | or | reducing | CO | 2 | emissions | affects | atmospheric | concentrations | regardless | of | location | this | is | one | of | the | rationales | behind | the | EU | CO | 2 | emissions | trading | scheme | This | implies | that | biomass | trading | of | solid | or | liquid | biofuels | 1 | is | not | the | only | option | for | trading | bioenergy | in | order | to | reduce | CO | 2 | emissions | If | the | biomass | is | used | domestically | it | could | enable | trade | in | CO | 2 | credits | or | some | kind | of | renewable | certificates | Trading | biomass | based | electricity | is | another | possibility | All | the | bioenergy | trading | options | have | the | potential | to | increase | the | total | use | of | biomass | since | they | increase | the | possibility | of | matching | supply | and | demand | for | biofuels | and | the | possibility | of | complying | with | targets | for | renewable | energy | sources | and | CO | 2 | emissions | reductions

Should | we | trade | biomass | electricity | renewable | certificates | or | CO | 2 | credits | The | question | was | raised | by | representatives | of | the | IEA | Bioenergy | Tasks | 35 | 38 | and | 40 | 11 | The | joint | Task | 38 | and | 40 | workshop | in | Trondheim | Norway | April | 2006 | initiated | a | discussion | on | accounting | rules | and | criteria | for | selecting | the | most | efficient | mechanisms | under | varying | circumstances | 2 | In | an | assessment | of | two | transportation | fuel | case | studies | Laurijssen | 12 | is | unable | to | make | any | firm | conclusion | about | whether | trading | biomass | or | trading | greenhouse | gas | emissions | credits | derived | from | bioenergy | projects | under | the | Clean | Development | Mechanism | CDM | and | Joint | Implementation | JI | is | more | attractive | from | a | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | and | cost | perspective | but | concludes | that | biomass | trade | could | be | preferable | if | other | aspects | such | as | diversification | of | energy | sources | and | job | creation | are | taken | into | consideration

The | purpose | of | this | paper | is | to | analyse | under | what | conditions | with | respect | to | CO | 2 | emission | reduction | and | biofuels | for | transport | targets | the | trading | in | the | EU | of | CO | 2 | credits | and | solid | and/or | liquid | biofuels | is | cost | effective | from | the | perspective | of | an | optimisation | energy | systems | model | We | also | investigate | how | electricity | production | from | biomass | is | affected | by | the | possibility | of | unlimited | electricity | trading | between | EU | countries | Trade | in | CO | 2 | credits | does | not | only | reflect | CO | 2 | emissions | reductions | due | to | the | use | of | biomass | but | also | those | due | to | other | energy | sources | considered | CO | 2 | neutral | and | energy | efficiency | measures | but | represents | the | case | in | which | domestic | use | of | bioenergy | is | preferable | Trade | in | renewable | certificates | is | not | included | in | the | analysis

Studies | have | shown | that | the | biofuels | for | transportation | option | is | less | cost | effective | for | reducing | CO | 2 | emissions | than | many | others | 13 | 14 | However | biofuels | might | be | important | for | reasons | not | included | in | those | analyses | for | example | to | increase | the | security | of | energy | supply | by | diversifying | it | and | to | reduce | oil | imports | or | because | other | options | in | the | transportation | sector | would | take | longer | to | implement | Future | fossil | fuels | in | the | transport | sector | i.e. | less | conventional | oil | resources | and | liquid | fuels | from | coal | may | also | yield | higher | CO | 2 | emissions | than | present | fuels | which | could | improve | the | situation | for | biofuels | for | transportation | Therefore | the | current | study | assesses | what | is | cost | effective | given | biofuels | for | transport | targets | We | will | qualify | results | as | cost | effective | in | terms | of | either | meeting | CO | 2 | targets | or | meeting | both | CO | 2 | and | biofuels | for | transport | targets

The | energy | and | transportation | systems | model | PEEP | Perspectives | on | European | Energy | Pathways | covering | the | EU27 | except | Bulgaria | Malta | and | Cyprus | and | including | CO | 2 | and | biofuels | fortransport | targets | is | modified | and | used | for | the | assessment | The | impact | of | whether | policy | targets | are | introduced | at | the | EU | level | or | at | the | national | level | is | part | of | the | analysis | The | study | focuses | on | opportunities | for | domestic | production | and | use | of | biomass | for | energy | in | the | EU | i.e. | the | study | primarily | considers | intra | European | bioenergy | trade | between | EU | countries | not | trade | within | countries | or | large | scale | imports | from | non | EU | countries | the | impact | of | the | latter | will | to | some | extent | be | assessed | in | the | sensitivity | analysis | At | present | approximately | 90 | of | the | biofuels | for | transportation | used | in | the | EU | are | produced | from | domestic | raw | materials | 15 | In | addition | the | biomass | supply | and | cost | potentials | in | the | new | MS | central | and | eastern | European | countries | CEEC | are | given | special | attention | using | data | from | the | EC | funded | projects | Viewls | and | Refuel | 3 | 7 | 8 | The | point | of | departure | in | this | study | is | that | the | difference | between | the | EU15 | and | the | CEEC | regarding | costs | persists | during | the | studied | time | period | even | though | this | difference | is | not | static | an | assumption | that | will | be | examined | in | the | sensitivity | analysis | The | overall | sustainability | of | the | bioenergy | trading | options | is | of | importance | but | is | not | included | in | this | study | which | focuses | on | CO | 2 | emissions

Results | of | earlier | analyses | with | the | PEEP | model | 16 | as | well | as | of | model | based | studies | of | the | relative | cost | effectiveness | of | bioenergy | use | in | different | sectors | in | the | context | of | global | climate | targets | 14 | 17 | indicate | that | in | a | 2020 | 2050 | perspective | biomass | is | preferably | used | for | other | purposes | than | stand | alone | electricity | production | see | Grahn | et | al | 18 | which | compares | the | results | in | Azar | et | al | 14 | and | Gielen | et | al | 17 | However | intra | European | electricity | trade | could | offer | an | opportunity | for | MS | with | large | biomass | resources | to | export | bioelectricity | to | other | MS | with | limited | options | for | producing | electricity | from | CO | 2 | neutral | energy | sources | This | could | make | biomass | based | electricity | more | attractive | in | some | countries | However | there | is | also | a | possibility | of | exporting/ | importing | electricity | from | other | energy | sources

This | study | represents | a | basic | initial | energy | system | modelling | approach | to | assess | the | competition | between | different | trading | options | for | bioenergy | from | a | cost | and | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | perspective | It | does | not | set | out | to | predict | the | future | EU | bioenergy | market | but | it | will | point | out | some | qualitative | insights | that | energy | systems | modelling | can | contribute | when | bioenergy | trade | options | are | being | weighed | Since | the | market | driving | current | bioenergy | trade | is | influenced | by | policies | it | is | valuable | for | policy | makers | to | know | which | bioenergy | trading | option | is | preferable | from | a | costeffective | and | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | perspective

Much | bioenergy | trade | takes | place | between | neighbouring | regions | or | countries | although | long | distance | trade | is | increasing | 19 | Within | Europe | official | statistics | for | bioenergy | trade | are | lacking | In | 2001 | the | international | trade | in | solid | biofuels | to | and | from | the | European | countries | was | estimated | to | be | at | least | 50 | PJ/ | year | based | on | data | for | 1999 | and | was | expected | to | increase | 20 | Figures | on | the | imports | and | exports | of | different | biomass | categories | for | several | of | the | EU | countries | are | available | in | national | reports | compiled | within | the | European | Commission | EC | funded | project | Eubionet | 2 | 21 | and | within | IEA | Bioenergy | Task | 40 | 4 | However | only | some | e.g. | Sweden | the | Netherlands | and | Estonia | make | it | possible | to | identify | the | trade | of | biomass | for | energy | purposes | The | present | world | trade | in | wood | fuel | is | described | in | Hillring | 22 | and | an | overview | of | the | global | production | and | trade | of | biomass | for | energy | is | given | in | Heinimo | ¨and | Junginger | 23 | which | estimates | the | international | biofuels | trade | in | 2004 | consisting | of | industrial | round | wood | and | wood | chips | ending | up | as | energy | and | ethanol | vegetable | oils | fuel | wood | and | charcoal | as | well | as | wood | pellets | at | about | 0.8 | EJ | The | future | potential | global | biofuels | trade | flow | in | 2050 | is | indicated | in | Hansson | et | al | 24 | and | over | the | century | in | Faaij | and | Domac | 19

For | this | study | we | have | used | the | regionalised | energy | and | transportation | systems | model | PEEP | Perspectives | on | European | Energy | Pathways | which | covers | the | EU27 | excluding | Malta | Cyprus | and | Bulgaria | Here | we | denote | the | group | of | countries | included | in | the | PEEP | model | EU | PEEP | is | developed | to | support | energy | and | transportation | systems | analyses | in | general | with | a | special | focus | on | bioenergy | aspects | see | Hansson | and | Berndes | 25 | for | a | description | of | PEEP | 1.0 | The | model | is | used | for | improving | systems | level | understanding | of | energy | and | transportation | in | the | EU | and | is | not | a | tool | for | predicting | the | future

The | PEEP | model | represents | a | simplified | account | of | the | European | energy | system | However | it | covers | a | large | number | of | plausible | energy | conversion | pathways | for | the | studied | time | period | except | for | carbon | capture | and | storage | and | electric | vehicles | mainly | due | to | the | time | frame | reasonable | estimates | of | related | relative | costs | and | descriptions | of | possible | trade | conditions | Because | our | analysis | focuses | on | a | qualitative | understanding | of | the | development | of | bioenergy | trade | in | the | EU | rather | than | on | delivering | a | detailed | quantitative | output | this | simplified | account | is | useful | Sensitivity | analysis | performed | by | randomly | as | well | as | systematically | varying | a | large | number | of | parameters | complements | our | interpretation | and | discussion | of | the | model | results | Section | 3.4 | PEEP | 1.1 | used | in | this | study | differs | from | PEEP | 1.0 | in | that | i | the | trade | related | data | have | been | modified | somewhat | see | Section | 2.1 | ii | the | initial | capacity | values | have | been | improved | using | Eurostat | 26 | primarily | for | the | heat | sector | iii | the | cost | of | implementing | biomass | co | firing | with | coal | is | set | to | USD100 | kW | of | biomass | based | electricity | capacity | 5 | iv | the | model | can | be | run | with | the | possibility | of | intra | EU | electricity | trade | v | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | requirements | can | be | defined | at | both | the | EU | and | the | national | level | and | vi | the | biofuels | for | transport | targets | including | also | other | renewable | fuels | for | transportation | can | also | be | defined | at | both | these | levels | and | have | been | revised | in | order | to | correspond | to | the | ambition | expressed | by | the | EC | 27 | for | 2020 | and | in | BIOFRAC | 28 | for | 2030 | whereas | the | general | introduction | targets | for | alternative | fuels | for | transportation | have | been | removed | See | Section | 2.2 | for | more | on | policy | targets

Treating | Europe | as | isolated | from | the | rest | of | the | world | limits | conclusions | about | future | EU | bioenergy | markets | since | the | bioenergy | market | is | global | However | for | the | scope | of | this | paper | this | delimitation | is | considered | suitable | since | the | focus | is | on | comparing | bioenergy | trading | options | within | the | EU | and | not | predicting | future | bioenergy | markets | Furthermore | modelling | global | trade | requires | assumptions | as | to | the | amount | of | global | biomass | and | biofuels | for | transportation | that | will | be | available | for | Europe | and | at | what | cost | these | are | highly | uncertain | parameters | In | addition | the | major | mechanisms | influencing | competition | between | bioenergy | trade | options | in | general | are | represented | on | the | European | market | this | means | the | results | from | this | case | study | may | apply | more | generally | As | part | of | the | sensitivity | analysis | the | impact | of | including | the | possibility | of | importing | biofuels | from | the | rest | of | the | world | to | the | EU | will | be | considered | However | in | general | the | indicated | bioenergy | trade | flows | within | the | EU | assume | that | there | is | no | biomass | trade | extending | beyond | the | EU | 's | border

The | PEEP | model | is | a | linear | optimisation | model | with | perfect | foresight | It | includes | 24 | countries | these | are | divided | into | EU15 | and | CEEC | and | has | three | end | use | sectors | electricity | transportation | fuels | and | heat | and | other | fuel | use | An | illustration | of | the | PEEP | model | is | given | in | Fig | 1 | The | optimisation | algorithm | decides | which | primary | energy | sources | energy | conversion | technologies | and | energy | carriers | should | be | used | to | meet | the | exogenously | defined | energy | demand | for | the | studied | time | period | at | the | lowest | energy | system | cost | net | present | value | costs | over | the | modelling | period | while | meeting | climate | related | policy | targets | Primary | energy | sources | include | oil | coal | natural | gas | direct | solar | energy | hydro | wind | and | different | kinds | of | biomass | lignocellulose | starch | sugar | oil | crops | as | well | as | residues | The | energy | carriers | include | heat | electricity | hydrogen | natural | gas | petrol | diesel | and | other | fossil | based | liquid | fuels | e.g. | coal | gas | based | methanol | and | FT | diesel | and | solid | biofuels | such | as | wood | chips | ethanol | biodiesel | and | fuels | derived | from | biomass | gasification | with | subsequent | synthesis | e.g. | DME | methanol | and | FT | diesel | All | technologies | have | their | own | characteristics | in | terms | of | investment | cost | lifetime | conversion | efficiency | and | load | factor | Electricity | and | some | fuels | for | transportation | can | be | produced | in | stand | alone | plants | without | making | use | of | excess | heat | or | combined | with | heat | production | for | e.g. | district | heating | systems | PEEP | includes | the | option | of | co | firing | biomass | with | coal | in | existing | power | plants | Biomass | co | firing | with | coal | within | the | existing | electricity | production | capacity | has | been | proposed | as | one | of | the | most | attractive | options | to | expand | biomass | use | for | energy | in | Europe | 29 | and | is | already | in | use | in | several | locations

The | studied | time | period | is | 2000 | 2030 | the | model | is | run | to | 2050 | to | avoid | possible | boundary | value | problems | and | the | model | provides | output | for | every | decade | which | is | a | sufficient | time | step | for | the | scope | of | the | study | The | energy | system | cost | includes | costs | for | fuel | capital | i.e. | conversion | plants | operation | and | maintenance | national | distribution | and | infrastructure | as | well | as | cost | for | intra | European | transportation | of | solid | and | liquid | biofuels | The | model | also | includes | exogenously | set | maximum | expansion | rates | for | the | different | energy | conversion | technologies | in | order | to | prevent | unrealistically | rapid | changes | of | energy | systems | In | relative | terms | the | rate | of | change | in | the | technology | specific | capital | stocks | is | not | allowed | to | exceed | 20 | per | year | and | in | absolute | terms | the | change | for | the | energy | conversion | technologies | is | related | to | the | total | energy | demand | in | the | region | it | is | assumed | that | 50 | years | is | required | for | Illustration | of | the | PEEP | model | The | thick | arrows | represent | energy | flows | within | the | model | and | the | thin | arrows | represent | exogenously | given | parameters | energy | demand | and | the | supply | of | primary | energy | sources | are | also | given | exogenously | The | biomass | category | lignocellulose | includes | residues | and | energy | crops | from | forestry | and | agriculture | the | energy | carrier | BGfuels | denotes | biofuels | based | on | biomass | gasification | with | subsequent | synthesis | e.g. | dimethylether | methanol | Fischer | Tropsch | diesel | and | petrol | represents | both | diesel | and | gasoline | complete | energy | system | turnover | i.e. | the | expansion | of | the | capital | stocks | per | decade | can | not | be | larger | than | one | fifth | of | the | total | national | capital | stock | in | use | There | are | also | expansion | rate | constraints | in | the | transportation | sector | where | the | introduction | of | alternative | gaseous | transportation | fuels | is | restricted | assuming | that | a | complete | replacement | of | the | vehicle | stock | requires | 40 | years | This | is | in | order | to | prevent | unrealistically | rapid | changes | and | means | that | as | a | maximum | 25 | 50 | 75 | and | 100 | of | the | transportation | sector | can | rely | on | gaseous | transportation | fuels | in | 2010 | 2020 | 2030 | and | 2040 | respectively | less | dramatic | changes | are | of | course | possible

The | energy | demand | in | the | three | end | use | sectors | at | the | national | level | is | based | on | the | baseline | projection | for | the | period | 2000 | 2030 | by | the | EC | 30 | Nuclear | power | is | treated | separately | because | its | development | is | highly | influenced | by | political | decisions | The | national | contribution | from | nuclear | power | for | the | studied | time | period | is | set | in | accordance | with | the | estimated | nuclear | electricity | supply | in | ref | 30 | Thus | the | electricity | demand | included | in | the | optimisation | is | equal | to | total | electricity | demand | minus | the | nuclear | electricity | supply | estimated | in | ref | 30 | Additional | exogenouslydefined | parameters | include | primary | energy | supply | potentials | and | costs | energy | conversion | characteristics | the | initial | energy | system | capital | stock | trade | parameters | and | CO | 2 | emissions | for | the | included | fossil | energy | sources | and | related | conversion | end | use | technologies

All | included | biomass | energy | except | for | the | internal | energy | demand | in | the | energy | sector | taken | into | consideration | in | the | exogenously | set | energy | demand | is | assumed | to | be | carbon | neutral | i.e. | changes | in | the | biospheric | carbon | stock | soil | and | above | ground | biomass | that | could | follow | from | a | large | scale | implementation | of | bioenergy | production | are | not | accounted | for | CO | 2 | emissions | from | the | use | of | fossil | fuels | are | allocated | to | the | country | where | they | are | used | except | in | the | case | of | trade | in | liquid | fossil | fuel | based | transportation | fuels | based | on | coal | and | natural | gas | which | are | allocated | to | the | production | country

The | supply | potentials | and | costs | for | the | different | biomass | types | used | in | the | model | are | summarised | in | Table | 1 | and | are | based | on | the | assessments | made | in | the | VIEWLS | and | Refuel | projects | Residue | availability | for | energy | is | estimated | based | on | scenarios | for | agriculture | and | forestry | development | 7 | Agriculture | scenarios | are | also | used | to | define | land | availability | for | energy | crop | production | which | is | set | equal | to | the | amount | of | land | not | used | for | food | production | that | could | support | energy | crop | production | based | on | 7 | 8 | 6 | with | an | additional | restriction | related | to | the | present | land | use | in | agriculture | for | the | years | 2000 | 2010 | 2020 | 2030 | the | energy | crop | area | is | not | allowed | to | exceed | 5 | 10 | 30 | and | 40 | respectively | of | the | 2000 | 2004 | average | extent | of | arable | land | and | land | under | permanent | crops | in | the | respective | country | as | reported | by | Eurostat | 31 | This | additional | restriction | is | introduced | based | on | the | judgment | that | biomass | supply | from | energy | crops | in | particular | lignocellulosic | crops | which | will | appear | to | be | the | cost | effective | choice | especially | in | the | near | term | will | likely | be | constrained | by | adoption | rates | among | farmers | rather | than | the | technical | availability | of | suitable | land | The | result | is | that | the | land | availability | for | bioenergy | in | the | EU | corresponds | to | 10 | 25 | and | 30 | of | the | average | 2000 | 2004 | extent | of | arable | land | and | land | under | permanent | crops | for | 2010 | 2020 | and | 2030 | respectively

The | cost | of | residues | is | based | on | Wakker | et | al | 32 | Energy | crop | production | costs | in | the | CEEC | up | to | 2030 | are | set | equal | to | the | weighted | average | estimated | costs | on | available | very | suitable | and | suitable | land | using | van | Dam | et | al | 7 | Production | costs | for | lignocellulosic | crops | in | the | EU15 | in | 2000 | are | set | based | on | Wakker | et | al | 32 | and | for | other | bioenergy | crops | the | costs | in | 2000 | are | set | based | on | data | in | the | FADN | 33 | which | are | in | the | same | range | as | Wit | et | al | 8 | The | production | cost | is | then | assumed | to | decrease | by | 0.5 | per | year | for | all | crop | types | in | the | EU15

From | 2010 | and | onward | EU | MS | may | import | export | biomass | or | solid | biofuels | except | for | sugar | crops | as | well | as | liquid | biofuels | from/ | to | other | MS | included | in | the | model | The | associated | biomass | transportation | cost | consists | of | a | handling | cost | and | a | distance | dependent | transportation | cost | for | solid | biofuels | this | is | set | based | on | Viewls | 34 | To | get | the | biomass | transportation | cost | a | cost | for | sea | transportation | and | land | transportation | representing | trucking | was | estimated | and | the | lowest | option | was | chosen | to | represent | the | trade | between | respective | countries | The | handling | cost | was | set | to | 0.3 | euro | GJ | for | sea | cargo | and | 0.15 | euro | GJ | for | land | cargo | sea | cargo | is | assumed | to | require | more | handling | events | than | truck | cargo | For | sea | cargo | a | transportation | cost | of | 0.00025 | euro | GJ | per | km | was | used | the | same | for | EU15 | and | CEEC | since | we | assume | that | shipping | is | an | international | market | For | land | cargo | the | cost | was | set | to | 0.003 | euro | GJ | per | km | for | trucking | within | the | EU15 | and | 0.001 | euro | GJ | per | km | for | trucking | within | the | CEEC | or | between | the | CEEC | and | the | EU15 | since | it | is | assumed | that | the | current | cost | difference | will | remain | in | place | during | the | studied | time | period | the | impact | is | assessed | in | the | sensitivity | analysis

The | estimated | distance | for | ship | and | land | transportation | between | the | EU | MS | was | chosen | so | as | to | correspond | to | the | transportation | distances | in | the | Biotrans | model | for | a | description | see | ref | 35 | 7 | The | distance | for | ship | transportation | is | retrieved | from | SeaPort | distance | calculators | http://www.world-register.com | http://www.distances.com | The | distance | for | land | transportation | a | The | biomass | supply | potential | is | calculated | by | adding | the | energy | content | of | all | available | lignocellulosic | residues | waste | and | energy | crop | output | given | that | lignocellulosic | crops | are | produced | on | the | total | area | that | is | available | for | energy | crop | production | in | each | region | at | each | point | in | time | The | residues | category | contains | residues | in | forestry | and | agriculture | b | The | biomass | supply | costs | include | the | costs | of | production | handling | and | storage | at | harvest | site | and | at | point | of | production | if | applicable | and | the | local | transportation | cost | calculated | assuming | an | average | of | 50 | km | of | local | transportation | 6 | An | important | assumption | is | that | Europe | will | maintain | its | current | level | of | self | sufficiency | for | food | and | feed | crops | as | well | as | for | livestock | products | Land | becomes | available | for | energy | crop | production | through | e.g. | yield | increases | and | improved | feed | conversion | efficiencies | 7 | In | reality | power | plants | are | sometimes | located | so | that | foreign | biomass | resources | are | produced | closer | and | are | possibly | less | expensive | than | some | of | the | domestic | resources | Conversely | foreign | biomass | resources | can | be | located | further | away | than | the | transport | distance | between | two | neighbouring | countries | that | is | set | in | the | model | database | Detailed | geographically | explicit | modelling | of | future | energy | demand | and | resource | supplies | -including | related | infrastructure | -could | provide | more | insights | into | the | magnitude | of | the | future | possible | bioenergy | trade | flows | between | the | EU | countries | However | it | is | beyond | the | scope | of | work | reported | here

between | two | neighbouring | MS | is | about | the | same | as | within | one | country | i.e. | 50 | km | If | two | EU | MS | do | not | share | a | border | the | land | transportation | is | set | to | equal | the | shortest | transportation | distance | between | the | countries | as | given | in | route | planners | http://www | map24.com | The | cost | for | biomass | transportation | including | handling | and | distance | is | presented | in | Table | 2 | For | simplicity | we | assume | based | on | Bo | ¨rjesson | and | Gustavsson | 36 | that | it | costs | twice | as | much | to | transport | solid | biomass | compared | with | liquid | biofuels | The | transportation | parameters | are | varied | in | the | sensitivity | analysis | There | are | no | maximal | capacity | constraints | for | biomass | transportation | since | the | aim | is | to | study | the | trade | mechanism | and | not | to | quantify | the | trade | flows | The | energy | demand | for | biomass | transportation | is | assumed | to | be | included | in | the | exogenously | set | demand | for | transportation | fuels | Thus | an | increase | in | biomass | trade | does | not | result | in | an | increased | demand | for | transportation | fuels | However | the | biomass | trade | associated | transportation | resulting | from | the | modelling | will | be | small | compared | with | the | total | demand | for | transportation | fuels | This | is | also | evaluated | separately | in | the | sensitivity | analysis

In | spite | of | the | fact | that | about | 10 | of | the | total | net | electricity | generation | in | the | EU27 | in | 2005 | was | exported | calculated | based | on | Eurostat | 37 | we | allow | electricity | trading | between | EU | countries | only | when | analysing | the | impact | of | electricity | trade | for | the | production | of | biomass | based | electricity | The | model | includes | no | capacity | constraints | for | or | costs | related | to | the | trade | in | electricity | but | the | importance | of | the | latter | is | assessed | in | the | sensitivity | analysis | Allowing | electricity | trading | between | EU | nations | in | the | other | analysis | would | require | a | more | detailed | modelling | approach | containing | e.g. | costs | and | capacity | constraints | which | is | outside | the | scope | of | this | study | However | the | impact | of | disregarding | electricity | trade | on | the | issues | addressed | in | this | study | will | be | assessed

The | climate | related | policies | in | the | model | include | a | CO | 2 | emission | cap | and | promotion | of | biofuels | and | other | renewable | fuels | i.e. | hydrogen | in | the | transportation | sector | The | CO | 2 | emissions | cap | places | an | upper | limit | on | the | total | emissions | from | fossil | fuel | use | in | all | the | included | EU | countries | and | over | all | sectors | during | the | entire | studied | time | period | The | limit | is | estimated | assuming | a | reduction | of | CO | 2 | emissions | by | 35 | in | 2020 | and | 40 | in | 2030 | compared | with | the | baseline | projection | in | the | European | Commission | 30 | which | is | then | applied | to | the | model | As | a | comparison | for | 2020 | the | specified | emission | reduction | corresponds | to | a | 30 | reduction | compared | with | the | emissions | in | 2000 | Note | that | only | direct | CO | 2 | emissions | from | the | energy | and | transportation | systems | are | considered | in | this | analysis | Thus | carbon | sources | and | sinks | from | land | use | changes | and | non | CO | 2 | greenhouse | gases | are | not | included | The | aggregated | CO | 2 | emissions | target | represents | the | possibility | to | trade | CO | 2 | credits | between | the | included | MS | without | any | associated | transaction | costs | National | CO | 2 | emissions | targets | are | obtained | by | dividing | the | total | CO | 2 | emissions | cap | in | proportion | to | the | share | of | total | emissions | in | the | baseline | projection | in | ref | 30 | In | the | transportation | sector | 5.75 | 10 | and | 25 | of | the | petrol | and | diesel | use | has | to | be | replaced | with | biofuels | and | other | renewable | fuels | in | 2010 | 2020 | and | 2030 | respectively | when | biofuels | for | transport | targets | are | applied | This | is | in | accordance | with | ref | 4 | for | 2010 | ref | 27 | for | 2020 | and | ref | 27 | for | 2030

The | model | is | run | with | the | following | five | policy | scenarios | where | the | targets | are | mandatory | and | include

i | an | aggregated | EU | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | target | ii | national | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | targets | iii | an | aggregated | EU | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | target | and | national | biofuels | for | transport | targets | iv | an | aggregated | EU | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | target | and | aggregated | EU | biofuels | for | transport | targets | and | v | national | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | targets | and | national | biofuels | for | transport | targets

An | overview | of | the | scenarios | is | given | in | Table | 3 | As | mentioned | above | an | aggregated | EU | CO | 2 | target | represents | the | case | where | CO | 2 | credits | can | be | traded | between | countries | without | any | transaction | cost | and | trade | in | electricity | is | included | as | an | option | in | the | model | only | when | the | impact | on | the | production | of | biomass | based | electricity | is | analysed | see | Section | 3.3 | On | the | other | hand | liquid | and | solid | biofuels | can | be | traded | in | all | scenarios

Which | bioenergy | trade | patterns | are | cost | effective | within | the | EU | under | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | and | biofuels | for | transport | related | policies | This | section | presents | the | bioenergy | trade | patterns | that | arise | in | PEEP | under | different | policy | regimes | Table | 3 | Lignocellulosic | biomass | dominates | the | supply | in | all | sectors

3.1 | Trade | in | biofuels | or | CO | 2 | emissions | credits

According | to | basic | economic | theory | a | cap | and | trade | system | allows | the | market | mechanism | to | find | cost | effective | carbon | abatement | solutions | 38 | This | is | the | rationale | for | the | joint | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | target | in | the | EU

In | line | with | basic | economic | theory | the | scenarios | with | an | aggregated | EU | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | target | representing | the | case | where | the | different | MS | can | trade | CO | 2 | credits | has | a | different | distribution | of | CO | 2 | emissions | and | a | lower | energy | system | cost | compared | with | the | corresponding | scenarios | with | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | targets | implemented | at | the | national | level | The | cost | for | meeting | the | policy | target | s | i.e. | the | difference | between | the | total | energy | system | cost | 8 | when | the | model | is | run | with | the | specific | policy | target(s | and | without | them | is | about | 2 | lower | for | scenario | i | than | for | scenario | ii | and | about | 3 | lower | for | scenario | iii | than | for | scenario | v | The | benefit | of | an | aggregated | target | compared | with | national | targets | of | course | depends | on | how | the | national | targets | are | set | If | carbon | credits | are | allocated | based | on | expected | demand | the | benefit | is | less | than | when | emissions | reduction | requirements | are | made | on | the | basis | of | considerations | of | equality | However | it | is | clear | that | trade | in | CO | 2 | credits | is | considered | a | cost | effective | option | in | the | model

Trade | in | biofuels | is | also | considered | a | cost | effective | bioenergy | trading | option | given | the | model | settings | In | both | scenarios | without | a | biofuel | for | transport | target | i | and | ii | there | is | trade | in | biofuels | represented | by | an | export | of | solid | biofuels | from | the | CEEC | to | the | EU15 | However | the | amount | of | biofuels | traded | is | lower | in | scenario | i | than | in | scenario | ii | due | to | the | possibility | of | trading | CO | 2 | emissions | credits | in | scenario | i | In | the | presence | of | biofuels | for | transport | targets | scenarios | iii)-(v | there | is | also | export | of | biofuels | from | the | CEEC | to | the | EU15 | now | both | solid | and | liquid | The | trade | is | highest | in | scenario | v | where | trade | in | CO | 2 | emissions | credits | is | not | possible | Thus | the | possibility | of | trading | CO | 2 | emissions | credits | implies | that | trade | in | biofuels | becomes | less | attractive | which | is | due | to | trade | in | biofuels | being | a | more | costly | option | The | trade | in | biofuels | depends | on | the | effort | to | use | bioenergy | with | high | CO | 2reduction | and | occurs | due | to | differences | between | the | EU | countries | with | respect | to | for | instance | present | use | of | energy | sources | energy | demand | domestic | availability | of | biomass | and | the | cost | of | biomass | for | energy | and | when | implemented | at | the | national | level | the | biofuels | for | transport | targets

An | aggregated | EU | biofuels | for | transport | target | results | in | a | somewhat | lower | cost | compared | with | when | the | biofuels | fortransport | targets | are | implemented | at | the | national | level | The | cost | for | meeting | the | biofuels | for | transport | target | i.e. | the | difference | between | the | total | energy | systems | cost | for | scenario | iii | or | iv | and | scenario | i | is | about | 2 | less | for | scenario | iv | than | for | scenario | iii | Thus | from | a | cost | effectiveness | perspective | given | CO | 2 | targets | aggregated | EU | targets | are | preferable | to | national | targets | also | in | the | case | of | biofuels | for | transport | targets | since | an | aggregated | target | promotes | the | most | cost | effective | biomass | use | for | the | policy | context | studied | and | means | that | some | transportation | of | biofuels | can | be | avoided | In | scenario | iii | up | to | about | 25 | of | the | total | amount | of | biofuels | for | transportation | produced | is | traded | while | this | share | is | substantially | lower | in | scenario | iv

The | implementation | of | mandatory | national | biofuels | for | transport | targets | will | induce | an | intra | European | trade | in | solid | or | liquid | biofuels | since | not | all | the | EU | MS | have | enough | national | biomass | resources | to | meet | these | targets | Given | the | maximal | national | supply | potential | for | biomass | adopted | in | the | PEEP | model | and | the | targets | for | biofuels | for | transport | used | this | will | be | the | case | for | e.g. | Luxembourg | and | the | Netherlands | in | 2010 | and | eventually | also | Belgium | Germany | Greece | Italy | Portugal | Spain | and | the | UK | assuming | a | conversion | efficiency | for | biofuels | from | biomass | of | 0.5

Without | biofuels | for | transport | targets | the | production | of | biofuels | for | transportation | and | production | of | liquid | biofuels | for | further | use | for | heat | and | electricity | production | are | not | considered | costeffective | options | in | the | model | given | the | chosen | context | 9 | Consequently | as | mentioned | above | only | solid | biofuels | are | traded | in | scenarios | i | and | ii | The | approximate | share | of | the | total | supply | of | biofuels | 2010 | 2030 | that | is | traded | is | about | 16 | in | scenario | i | and | 24 | in | scenario | ii

In | the | scenarios | including | national | biofuels | for | transport | targets | iii | and | v | there | is | trade | in | both | solid | biofuels | and | liquid | biofuels | for | transportation | The | total | trade | in | biofuels | is | larger | in | the | case | of | a | national | CO | 2 | target | scenario | v | than | in | the | case | of | an | aggregated | EU | CO | 2 | target | scenario | iii | Thus | in | a | policy | regime | involving | CO | 2 | and | national | biofuels | for | transport | targets | it | is | found | to | be | cost | effective | to | trade | both | solid | and | liquid | biofuels | The | approximate | share | of | the | total | supply | of | biofuels | 2010 | 2030 | that | is | traded | both | solid | and | liquid | is | 22 | and | 26 | in | scenario | iii | and | v | respectively | The | reason | for | the | liquid | biofuels | trade | is | that | it | is | preferable | to | import | liquid | biofuels | for | transport | instead | of | importing | solid | biomass | for | domestic | conversion | to | transportation | fuels | due | to | the | fact | that | the | liquid | biofuels | are | assumed | to | have | a | lower | transportation | cost | due | to | their | higher | energy | density | The | solid | biofuels | trade | arises | because | solid | biofuels | can | be | used | for | more | cost | effective | CO | 2 | emissions | reductions | by | replacing | coal | in | the | importing | country | than | the | import | of | liquid | biofuels | which | replace | gasoline | diesel | in | the | transportation | sector | Thus | the | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | target | drives | the | trade | in | solid | biofuels | and | the | biofuels | for | transport | target | drives | the | trade | in | liquid | biofuels | the | trade | in | solid | biofuels | is | lower | in | the | presence | of | biofuels | fortransport | targets | than | without

Even | though | both | policy | targets | are | at | the | EU | level | in | scenario | iv | there | is | trade | in | both | solid | and | liquid | biofuels | This | result | clashes | with | the | intuitive | expectation | that | trade | in | liquid | biofuels | will | not | be | needed | when | the | target | is | set | at | the | EU | level | In | contrast | with | the | other | scenarios | this | modelling | outcome | is | to | a | large | extent | a | result | of | the | exogenously | set | expansion | rate | constraints | for | alternative | fuels | in | the | transportation | sector | as | well | as | the | other | expansion | constraints | The | reason | for | the | remaining | liquid | biofuels | trade | in | 2030 | that | can | not | be | explained | by | the | expansion | rate | constraints | and | that | amounts | to | about | 1 | of | the | total | amount | of | biofuels | for | transportation | produced | is | that | when | the | use | of | coal | has | been | phased | out | some | minor | liquid | biofuels | trade

from | countries | that | have | only | biofuels | in | the | transportation | sector | is | cost | effective | due | to | the | lower | transportation | costs | for | liquid | biofuels | compared | with | solid | biofuels | and | the | fuels | capacity | to | reduce | CO | 2 | emissions | Approximately | 20 | of | the | total | supply | of | biofuels | 2010 | 2030 | is | traded | in | scenario | iv

The | PEEP | model | construction | does | not | allow | for | explicit | monitoring | of | biomass | based | electricity | trade | flows | preventing | us | from | drawing | conclusions | about | the | trade | in | biomass | based | electricity | and | its | cost | effectiveness | The | model | keeps | track | of | the | electricity | trade | between | countries | but | not | the | energy | sources | used | to | produce | the | electricity | In | principle | this | represents | the | actual | situation | However | to | investigate | the | impact | of | electricity | trade | on | the | cost | effectiveness | of | electricity | production | from | biomass | in | the | model | we | study | if | the | possibility | of | trading | electricity | increases | the | use | of | biomass | for | electricity

For | all | scenarios | in | the | absence | of | electricity | trade | the | total | EU15 | þ | CEEC | biomass | based | electricity | production | increases | to | about | 5 | of | total | electricity | production | in | 2010 | but | decreases | thereafter | as | biomass | is | more | cost | effectively | used | for | heat | production | and/or | more | biomass | is | required | in | the | transportation | sector | CO | 2 | emissions | in | the | electricity | sector | are | instead | decreased | by | an | increased | use | of | natural | gas | and | wind | power | Biomass | cofiring | with | coal | explains | the | initial | increase | of | biomass | based | electricity | When | the | possibility | of | co | firing | biomass | with | coal | is | excluded | the | share | of | biomass | based | electricity | decreases | for | the | studied | time | period | in | each | scenario | Since | coal | based | power | production | is | drastically | reduced | during | the | studied | time | period | biomass | co | firing | with | coal | is | an | attractive | option | for | electricity | production | only | in | the | near | term | note | that | carbon | capture | and | storage | is | not | included | as | an | option

When | electricity | trade | is | allowed | the | amount | of | biomassbased | electricity | increases | in | all | scenarios | The | increase | is | small | about | 3 | 5 | more | biomass | based | electricity | in | each | year | in | all | scenarios | except | scenario | v | where | the | increase | approaches | 80 | in | 2030 | However | biomass | based | electricity | is | still | a | minor | share | of | total | electricity | production | in | all | scenarios | In | scenario | v | it | is | not | possible | to | trade | CO | 2 | credits | and | there | is | no | driver | for | trade | in | biofuels | for | transportation | these | factors | help | explain | the | large | increase | When | electricity | trading | is | possible | it | becomes | costeffective | to | co | fire | more | biomass | with | coal | for | electricity | production | in | some | nations

Without | the | co | firing | possibility | the | electricity | trading | option | does | not | result | in | more | biomass | based | electricity | in | scenarios | i | iii | and | iv | and | the | increases | noted | in | scenarios | ii | and | v | are | minor | and | a | result | of | the | expansion | rate | constraints | Thus | in | this | case | electricity | trading | does | not | make | biomass | based | electricity | a | more | cost | effective | option | in | the | model

The | possibility | of | trading | electricity | does | not | influence | the | main | findings | in | Sections | 3.1 | and | 3.2 | but | does | influence | the | magnitude | of | the | biofuels | trade | flows | In | general | solid | biofuels | trade | flows | are | reduced | while | liquid | biofuels | trade | flows | are | increased

In | order | to | analyse | the | impact | of | the | possibility | of | large | scale | biofuels | imports | from | non | EU | countries | the | following | assumptions | are | made | i | all | EU | countries | may | import | biofuels | from | the | rest | of | the | world | ii | the | total | amount | of | solid | biofuels | that | can | be | imported | from | the | rest | of | the | world | corresponds | to | 30 | or | 60 | of | the | total | biomass | supply | potential | in | the | EU | see | Table | 1 | iii | the | total | amount | of | liquid | biofuels | that | can | be | imported | from | the | rest | of | the | world | corresponds | to | 30 | of | the | EU | demand | for | biofuels | for | transportation | in | accordance | with | the | so | called | balanced | approach | in | ref | 39 | but | the | case | with | 60 | is | also | assessed | iv | the | cost | for | the | liquid | biofuels | from | outside | the | EU | is | 10 | euro | GJ | based | on | Hamelinck | 40 | and | the | cost | for | the | solid | biofuels | is | 1 | euro | GJ | i.e. | lower | than | the | production | cost | for | domestic | solid | biofuels

Trading | biofuels | and | trading | CO | 2 | credits | are | both | considered | cost | effective | options | even | with | biofuels | imports | from | non | EU | countries | independent | of | share | assessed | In | all | scenarios | there | is | still | intra | European | trade | with | solid | biofuels | in | scenarios | i | and | ii | and | both | liquid | and | solid | biofuels | in | scenarios | iii)-(v | but | the | intra | European | trade | is | reduced | However | when | the | model | allows | for | import | of | 100 | of | the | EU | demand | for | biofuels | for | transportation | there | is | no | intra | European | trade | in | liquid | biofuels | for | transportation | However | in | reality | some | EU | countries | have | better | prerequisites | for | imports | from | non | EU | countries | than | others | suggesting | that | imports | from | non | EU | countries | might | not | completely | reduce | the | intra | EU | trade | in | liquid | biofuels

Trade | in | electricity | still | results | in | an | increased | production | of | biomass | based | electricity | in | the | case | with | biofuels | imports | from | non | EU | countries | given | that | large | scale | implementation | of | biomass | co | firing | with | coal | is | allowed | However | the | electricitytrade | prompted | increase | in | biomass | based | electricity | is | smaller | with | biofuels | imports | from | outside | the | EU | especially | in | scenario | v

The | study | assumes | that | there | is | a | difference | in | biomass | production | costs | between | the | EU15 | and | the | CEEC | This | is | removed | by | setting | the | biomass | supply | categories | at | the | average | cost | for | the | EU15 | presented | in | Table | 1 | and | the | transportation | cost | for | biomass | at | the | EU15 | cost | level | The | biofuels | trade | flows | are | not | only | a | result | of | the | assumed | cost | difference | between | the | EU15 | and | the | CEEC | The | conclusions | regarding | the | cost | effectiveness | of | the | different | bioenergy | trade | options | are | still | valid | However | the | amount | of | biofuels | traded | changes | to | some | extent | less | than | halved | and | in | scenarios | i | and | ii | there | is | no | longer | only | trade | from | the | CEEC | to | the | EU15 | even | if | this | is | the | dominating | biofuels | trade | flow | Otherwise | the | trade | flows | are | as | before | only | solid | biofuels | with | only | CO | 2 | targets | and | both | solid | and | liquid | biofuels | with | CO | 2 | as | well | as | biofuels | fortransport | targets

Biomass | transportation | cost | changes | do | not | influence | the | conclusions | regarding | the | cost | effectiveness | of | the | different | bioenergy | trade | options | and | the | presence | of | the | different | biofuels | trade | flows | However | the | sizes | of | the | biofuels | trade | flows | change | to | some | extent | a | reduced | transportation | cost | in | general | leads | to | an | increased | biofuels | trade | and | an | increased | transportation | cost | in | general | leads | to | a | reduced | biofuels | trade

Compared | with | the | total | CO | 2 | emissions | during | the | entire | time | period | the | CO | 2 | emissions | that | the | transportation | of | biofuels | would | yield | are | small | For | scenario | v | with | the | largest | biofuels | trade | the | total | CO | 2 | emissions | that | the | biofuels | trade | would | yield | correspond | to | about | 0.04 | of | the | total | CO | 2 | emissions | when | assuming | an | energy | content | of | solid | and | liquid | biofuels | at | 20 | and | 21 | GJ | ton | respectively | and | energy | requirements | for | sea | and | road | transportation | at | 0.2 | MJ/(ton | km | and | 1.3 | MJ/(ton | km | respectively | The | estimated | CO | 2 | emissions | from | the | transportation | of | biofuels | are | equivalent | to | roughly | 1 | of | the | emissions | reduction | that | the | use | of | the | traded | biofuels | in | scenario | v | yield | assuming | coal | and | gasoline | are | replaced | for | liquid | biofuels | and | less | for | solid | biofuels | This | indicates | that | the | impact | of | introducing | CO | 2 | emissions | directly | associated | with | the | transportation | of | biofuels | should | be | small | More | generally | the | issue | concerns | how | an | expanding | bioenergy | use | influences | the | total | demand | for | energy | which | is | addressed | in | life | cycle | analysis | and | not | further | discussed | here

Model | runs | where | the | biofuels | trade | gives | rise | to | additional | CO | 2 | emissions | assuming | all | the | trade | takes | place | with | the | aid | of | trucks | running | on | petrol | show | that | the | impact | of | this | is | minor | The | conclusions | regarding | the | cost | effectiveness | of | the | different | bioenergy | trade | options | and | the | presence | of | different | biofuels | trade | flows | are | not | influenced | The | amount | of | biofuels | traded | and | the | increase | in | biomass | based | electricity | with | the | possibility | of | electricity | trade | are | changed | to | some | extent

With | electricity | trading | carrying | a | cost | up | to | roughly | 1 | euro | GJ | there | is | still | an | increase | in | biomass | based | electricity | in | the | electricity | trading | scenarios | compared | with | those | excluding | this | trade | However | when | electricity | trading | costs | 10 | euro | GJ | biomass | based | electricity | production | only | increases | in | scenario | v

Since | the | outcome | of | energy | system | modelling | depends | on | assumptions | about | future | costs | and | technical | performance | the | robustness | of | the | findings | on | cost | effectiveness | have | been | carefully | assessed | with | random | simultaneous | variations | of | parameter | values | In | the | sensitivity | analysis | 50 | scenarios | within | each | of | the | five | model | scenarios | were | generated | by | random | simultaneous | variation | of | parameters | according | to | uniform | distributions | around | the | original | parameter | settings | described | in | Section | 2 | and | in | Hansson | and | Berndes | 25 | The | variation | intervals | for | the | parameters | are | described | in | Table | 4

The | conclusion | regarding | the | cost | effectiveness | of | trading | CO | 2 | credits | is | found | to | be | robust | The | cost | for | meeting | the | policy | target(s | is | always | lower | when | the | CO | 2 | target | is | set | at | the | EU | level | instead | of | at | the | national | level | It | is | about | 1 | 11 | lower | for | scenario | i | than | for | scenario | ii | and | about | 1 | 4 | lower | for | scenario | iii | than | for | scenario | v | when | the | runs | in | the | sensitivity | analysis | are | compared | Thus | the | difference | is | generally | of | the | same | order | as | for | the | original | runs | at | 2 | and | 3 | respectively

The | conclusions | regarding | trade | in | biofuels | hold | for | all | variations | of | the | scenarios | with | the | exception | that | it | in | a | few | variants | of | scenario | i | and | ii | it | turns | out | to | be | cost | effective | also | with | some | minor | trade | in | liquid | biofuels | for | transportation | In | these | specific | scenario | variants | CO | 2 | emissions | need | to | be | reduced | in | the | transportation | sector | in | order | to | meet | the | CO | 2 | target | due | to | restrictions | in | the | model | e.g. | on | technology | options | and | expansion | rates | This | drives | trade | in | minor | amounts | of | liquid | biofuels | for | transportation

The | cost | for | meeting | the | biofuels | for | transport | target | i.e. | the | difference | between | the | total | energy | systems | cost | for | scenario | iii | or | iv | and | scenario | i | is | about | 0.2 | 4 | less | for | scenario | iv | with | the | target | at | the | EU | level | than | for | scenario | iii | with | the | target | at | the | national | level | This | corresponds | well | to | the | value | reported | earlier | at | 2

The | findings | regarding | the | impact | of | electricity | trade | on | the | cost | effectiveness | of | electricity | production | from | biomass | is | less | robust | However | for | the | majority | of | the | random | sensitivity | runs | the | possibility | of | electricity | trade | somewhat | increases | production | of | biomass | based | electricity | In | about | 30 | of | the | runs | the | impact | is | instead | a | decrease

The | PEEP | model | is | used | to | study | how | mandatory | targets | within | the | EU | for | CO | 2 | emissions | reductions | and | for | biofuels | for | transportation | affect | the | cost | effectiveness | of | intra | European | trade | in | bioenergy | The | following | conclusions | can | be | drawn

Trade | in | biofuels | mainly | exports | from | the | CEEC | to | the | EU15 | is | cost | effective | in | all | assessed | scenarios | When | included | as | an | option | trade | in | CO | 2 | credits | is | a | cost | effective | option | in | the | model | The | CO | 2 | emissions | credit | trading | option | makes | the | trade | in | biofuels | less | attractive | In | the | case | of | CO | 2 | targets | with | or | without | the | credit | trading | option | there | is | trade | in | solid | biofuels | When | national | biofuelsfor | transport | targets | are | also | implemented | both | trade | in | solid | and | liquid | biofuels | are | cost | effective | With | both | policy | targets | applied | at | the | EU | level | this | result | also | holds | given | that | the | change | of | fuels | in | the | transportation | sector | is | not | implemented | instantaneously | The | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | target | drives | the | trade | in | solid | biofuels | and | the | biofuels | for | transport | target | drives | the | trade | in | liquid | biofuels | The | implementation | of | mandatory | national | biofuels | fortransport | targets | in | accordance | with | the | EU | goals | induces | trade | in | solid | biofuels | or | biofuels | for | transportation | in | the | model | since | it | is | indicated | that | some | EU | countries | do | not | have | sufficient | assessed | national | biomass | supply | potentials | to | meet | these | targets | This | result | of | course | depends | on | the | size | of | assessed | domestic | biomass | potentials | which | varies | between | studies | However | the | trade | in | liquid | biofuels | is | not | only | a | result | of | some | countries | not | having | enough | biomass | to | meet | the | biofuels | for | transport | target | In | order | to | reach | mandatory | biofuels | for | transport | targets | cost | effectively | from | the | EU | perspective | aggregated | EU | biofuels | for | transport | targets | are | preferable | to | national | targets | With | access | to | relatively | cheap | options | for | biomass | based | electricity | production | such | as | biomass | co | firing | with | coal | the | possibility | of | electricity | trade | in | general | leads | to | a | somewhat | increased | production | of | biomass | based | electricity | It | is | of | interest | to | further | study | the | cost | effectiveness | of | electricity | from | biomass

Options | and | factors | that | are | not | included | in | this | analysis | could | influence | these | conclusions | Cost | effectiveness | is | not | the | only | criterion | for | policy | makers | dealing | with | climate | change | The | actual | development | of | the | European | bioenergy | market | will | be | determined | by | other | factors | in | addition | to | policies | for | CO | 2 | emissions | reduction | and | stimulation | of | biofuels | for | transportation | such | as | the | development | of | international | bioenergy | trade | Countries | with | substantial | biomass | potentials | may | also | choose | to | go | in | other | directions | depending | on | their | expectations | about | European | international | policy | and | market | development | For | example | if | they | expect | that | demand | for | biofuels | for | transportation | will | become | high | in | the | future | they | might | prefer | to | support | the | development | of | a | domestic | biofuels | industry | rather | than | using | all | the | biomass | for | heat | and | power | despite | the | fact | that | this | might | maximise | the | near | term | climate | benefits | of | biomass | use | From | the | perspective | of | an | individual | company | it | could | be | attractive | to | import | biofuels | e.g. | for | cofiring | with | coal | instead | of | using | only | coal | and | compensating | with | CO | 2 | credits | if | it | is | considered | strategically | beneficial | to | invest | in | the | use | of | renewable | energy | sources | Whether | the | trade | will | be | dominated | by | European | biofuels | or | biofuels | from | the | rest | of | the | world | will | depend | on | the | balance | in | the | EU | between | promoting | free | trade | and | import | from | countries | outside | the | EU | and | the | strategic | value | of | developing | a | biofuels | industry | that | to | a | large | extent | is | based | on | domestic | biomass | resources | Factors | other | than | those | included | in | the | model | point | toward | a | joint | target | for | biofuels | for | transport | or | at | least | different | targets | in | different | countries | Some | countries | have | in | addition | to | a | relatively | large | biomass | supply | potential | better | prerequisites | for | biofuels | production | than | others | For | example | countries | with | pulp | and | paper | industry | have | opportunities | to | produce | biofuels | for | transportation | from | by | products | such | as | black | liquor | In | addition | some | countries | have | a | more | ambitious | strategy | for | reducing | CO | 2 | emissions | and | stronger | support | for | the | introduction | of | biofuels | for | transportation | Thus | the | need | for | a | broad | introduction | of | biofuels | in | all | the | transportation | sectors | in | the | EU | countries | should | be | put | in | relation | to | the | benefit | of | a | more | focused | introduction

The | bioenergy | trade | flows | indicated | in | the | PEEP | model | could | be | placed | in | perspective | by | comparing | them | with | the | present | trade | flows | in | the | forestry | sector | Most | of | the | bioenergy | trade | among | countries | in | northern | Europe | is | conducted | in | integration | with | this | trade | such | as | the | use | of | ports | and | storage | facilities | for | e.g. | bark | sawdust | and | other | residues | from | imported | roundwood | 19 | However | the | use | of | bioenergy | in | the | PEEP | model | is | to | a | large | extent | based | on | energy | crop | production | which | indicates | that | the | future | biofuels | trade | flows | will | be | less | influenced | by | the | logistic | systems | connected | to | the | forestry | sector

In | order | to | assess | the | magnitude | of | the | future | possible | bioenergy | trade | flows | between | the | EU | countries | it | would | be | interesting | to | match | the | potential | biomass | demand | with | the | local/ | regional | biomass | supply | possibilities | taking | into | consideration | the | possibility | for | imports | from | countries | outside | Europe
