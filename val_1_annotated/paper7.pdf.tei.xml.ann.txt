The | environmental | impacts | of | economic | activities | have | become | an | important | aspect | in | the | evaluation | of | their | overall | performance | Consistently | traditional | measures | of | technical | efficiency | have | been | extended | to | assess | both | the | economic | and | environmental | performance | of | firms | This | study | aims | to | use | these | measures | to | analyze | the | performance | of | a | sample | of | Catalan | arable | crop | farms | Specifically | we | apply | the | methodology | recently | developed | by | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | and | Murty | et | al | 2012 | and | extend | it | to | a | consideration | of | the | stochastic | conditions | under | which | production | takes | place | as | proposed | by | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 1998 | and | 2000 | Results | suggest | that | efficiency | ratings | depend | on | model | specification | Also | ignoring | the | stochastic | nature | of | production | yields | downward | biased | efficiency | scores | Empirical | findings | suggest | that | environmental | and | technical | efficiency | are | strongly | interrelated | indicating | that | an | efficient | use | of | chemical | inputs | improves | both | environmental | and | technical | performance | of | farms

Intensive | agricultural | systems | have | several | harmful | impacts | on | humans | animals | and | the | environment | e.g. | impacts | on | human | health | pollution | of | underground | and | surface | water | loss | of | biodiversity | or | overutilization | of | natural | resources | These | impacts | have | increased | social | and | political | concerns | regarding | agriculture | related | negative | externalities | At | the | political | level | these | concerns | have | led | the | European | Union | 's | EU | agricultural | policies | to | increasingly | focus | on | environmental | considerations | Interest | in | promoting | agricultural | practices | that | minimize | pollution | has | been | growing | European | Commission | 2010 | and | various | policies | have | been | devised | to | encourage | farmers | to | use | less | chemical | inputs | and | to | adopt | environmentally | friendly | practices | European | Commission | 2013 | These | alternative | practices | however | can | affect | the | productivity | and | efficiency | with | which | farms | are | operating | which | in | turn | can | influence | their | economic | viability

Since | its | inception | in | 1962 | the | EU | 's | Common | Agricultural | Policy | CAP | has | been | continuously | reshaping | itself | While | its | initial | objectives | focused | on | farm | income | support | policy | scopes | have | been | widened | to | embrace | environmental | preservation | Later | CAP | reform | proposals | have | aimed | at | aligning | the | CAP | with | the | targets | of | the | Europe | 2020 | framework | and | call | for | environmental | sustainability | higher | efficiency | effectiveness | and | equitability | European | Commission | 2010 | Noteworthy | among | the | reform | proposals | is | the | aim | to | redistribute | CAP | direct | payments | based | on | both | economic | and | environmental | criteria | In | light | of | current | CAP | reform | debates | it | is | important | to | develop | tools | to | support | monitoring | the | impacts | of | policy | and | to | assist | in | better | targeting | policy | measures

Deriving | farm | level | technical | and | environmental | efficiency | TE | and | EE | respectively | indices | should | be | a | relevant | tool | for | improved | CAP | payment | redistribution | While | high | TE | measures | are | a | pre | requisite | for | economic | sustainability | high | environmental | performance | indicators | should | contribute | to | the | environmental | sustainability | of | agricultural | practices | Recent | literature | on | efficiency | has | been | searching | for | adequate | methods | to | derive | these | measures

Farm | level | transition | to | environmentally | sustainable | practices | can | be | regarded | as | a | three | stage | process | with | different | degrees | of | environmental | impact | reduction | efficiency | substitution | and | redesign | Wossink | and | Denaux | 2007 | Our | analysis | focuses | on | the | first | phase | which | aims | at | minimizing | the | use | of | polluting | inputs | and | optimizing | input | allocation | to | achieve | the | desired | output | levels | A | farm | can | be | considered | environmentally | inefficient | if | pollution | per | unit | of | input | is | above | an | ideal | minimum | On | the | other | hand | technical | inefficiencies | arise | when | firms | are | unable | to | maximize | their | output | levels | with | minimum | use | of | inputs | Farrell | 1957 | While | privatelyrun | farms | are | likely | to | achieve | a | high | TE | level | involving | optimal | conventional | input | output | use | they | are | less | likely | to | be | environmentally | efficient | due | to | a | lack | of | economic | incentives | and | information | bounded | rationality | or | lack | of | external | competitive | pressure | regarding | environmental | performance | Wossink | and | Denaux | 2007

During | recent | decades | the | scientific | community | has | produced | numerous | studies | that | attempt | to | evaluate | the | aggregate | external | costs | of | modern | agriculture | Pimentel | et | al | 1992 | and | 1995 | Evans | 1995 | and | 1996 | Bailey | et | al | 1999 | Tiezzi | 1999 | Pretty | et | al | 2000 | Le | Goffe | 2000 | Tegtmeier | and | Duffy | 2004 | place | the | value | of | the | negative | impact | of | agriculture | on | water | land | air | and | human | health | at | around | 29.44 | to | 95.68 | per | hectare | in | the | United | States | In | another | study | Pretty | et | al | 2000 | obtained | a | value | of | 325 | 1 | dollars | for | the | United | Kingdom | with | the | following | categories | being | the | most | relevant | sources | of | environmental | damage | contamination | by | pesticides | greenhouse | gas | emissions | damage | to | wildlife | and | habitats | as | well | as | food | poisoning | by | bacteria | and | viruses | and | other | disease | agents

In | contrast | to | most | sustainability | indicators | that | have | been | defined | at | an | aggregate | level | farm | level | efficiency | measures | are | directly | linked | to | firm | management | decision | making | While | aggregate | level | studies | can | be | very | useful | for | politicians | and | society | and | can | help | in | agricultural | and | environmental | policy | design | they | do | not | provide | useful | information | for | decision | making | units | DMU | that | is | groups | of | individuals | who | are | more | concerned | about | the | economic | and | environmental | performance | of | their | holdings | Thus | unlike | many | environmental | performance | measures | that | have | been | defined | at | the | aggregate | level | our | study | focuses | on | estimating | combined | measures | of | TE | and | EE | at | the | microeconomic | level | To | achieve | this | objective | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | and | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | efficiency | measures | are | extended | to | a | consideration | of | the | stochastic | environment | in | which | production | takes | place | A | Tobit | analysis | is | then | conducted | to | identify | the | determinants | of | farm | performance

The | paper | is | organized | as | follows | In | the | next | section | a | literature | review | and | the | contribution | of | this | work | to | previous | literature | is | presented | We | then | describe | the | methodology | used | in | our | empirical | analysis | The | fourth | section | presents | the | data | and | results | from | the | empirical | implementation | and | we | finish | the | paper | with | concluding | remarks

First | attempts | to | measure | firm | level | EE | considered | a | firm | 's | environmental | impacts | either | as | an | input | or | an | output | Fa | ¨re | et | al | 1989 | and | 1996 | using | Data | Envelopment | Analysis | DEA | techniques | incorporated | pollution | into | productive | efficiency | analyses | as | a | weakly | disposable | bad | output | which | implies | the | assumption | that | the | reduction | of | pollution | is | expensive | In | other | words | reducing | pollution | comes | at | the | cost | of | reducing | the | amount | of | the | good | output | These | authors | develop | a | hyperbolic | productive | efficiency | model | that | credits | producers | for | providing | desirable | outputs | and | penalizes | them | for | generating | undesirable | outputs | Evidence | that | ignoring | undesirable | outputs | distorts | the | magnitude | of | efficiency | is | obtained | through | the | empirical | analysis | of | a | sample | of | U.S. | paper | mills | Fa | ¨re | et | al | 1989 | and | U.S. | electric | utilities | Fa | ¨re | et | al | 1996

Piot | Lepetit | and | Vermersch | 1998 | and | Arandia | and | Aldanondo | 2007 | follow | Fa | ¨re | et | al | 1989 | and | 1996 | in | considering | pollution | as | a | bad | output | Conversely | Reihard | et | al | 1999 | and | 2002 | model | pollution | as | an | input | in | the | production | technology | Førsund | et | al | 2008 | and | Murty | et | al | 2012 | have | shown | that | reduced | form | technologies | that | consider | pollution | either | as | an | input | or | an | output | have | serious | weaknesses | Førsund | et | al | 2008 | propose | the | materials | balance | principle | that | is | representing | the | key | role | of | inputs | in | residual | generation | as | an | alternative | method | to | model | pollution | Reinhard | and | Thijssen | 2000 | Asmild | and | Hougaard | 2006 | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | and | Murty | et | al | 2012 | model | pollution | along | these | lines | While | previous | literature | has | paid | considerable | attention | to | adjusting | efficiency | and | productivity | measures | by | considering | negative | externalities | associated | to | production | a | few | recent | analyses | have | incorporated | the | provision | of | environmental | goods | in | the | vector | of | farms | good | outputs | e.g. | Omer | et | al | 2007 | Areal | et | al | 2012 | Sipila | ¨inen | and | Huhtala | 2013

A | summary | of | the | articles | reviewed | is | presented | in | table | 1 | Among | these | papers | we | focus | on | the | pathbreaking | proposals | by | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | and | Murty | et | al | 2012 | Within | the | environmental | efficiency | measurement | literature | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | suggest | a | new | approach | that | does | not | require | the | introduction | of | an | extra | pollution | variable | in | the | production | model | The | Limited | ability | of | sample | farms | to | reduce | nitrogen | pollution | for | given | output | levels | Reinhard | et | al | 1999 | Pollution | as | an | input | SFA | Dutch | dairy | farms | producing | milk | and | organic | nitrogen | as | a | byproduct | Ample | scope | to | reduce | pollution | is | found | average | environmental | efficiency | levels | on | the | order | of | 0.44 | are | found | Arandia | and | Aldanondo | 2007 | Pollution | as | an | weakly | and | strongly | disposable | output | DEA | Spanish | wine | farms | producing | grape | and | excess | nitrogen | and | pesticide | pollution | as | by | products

Results | are | very | sensitive | to | the | weak | versus | strong | disposability | assumption | of | bad | outputs | Reinhard | et | al | 2002 | Pollution | as | an | input | SFA | Dutch | dairy | farms | producing | milk | and | organic | nitrogen | as | a | by | product | Ample | scope | to | reduce | pollution | is | found | average | environmental | efficiency | levels | on | the | order | of | 0.57 | -0.43 | are | derived | Asmild | and | Hougaard | 2006 | Pollution | is | modeled | through | the | materials | balance | concept | DEA | Danish | pig | farms | producing | milk | and | excess | organic | nitrogen | as | a | by | product | Ample | scope | to | reduce | pollution | is | found | average | environmental | efficiency | levels | on | the | order | of | 0.34 | -0.56 | are | derived | Reinhard | and | Thijssen | 2000 | Pollution | is | modeled | through | the | materials | balance | concept

Dutch | dairy | farms | producing | milk | and | organic | nitrogen | as | a | by | product | Ample | scope | to | reduce | pollution | is | found | average | environmental | efficiency | levels | on | the | order | of | 0.56 | are | derived | proposal | is | illustrated | by | studying | environmental | performance | of | a | sample | of | farms | specializing | in | pig | finishing | in | Belgium | using | DEA | techniques | under | a | constant | returns | to | scale | CRS | assumption | Based | on | the | materials | balance | principle | the | nutrient | surplus | produced | by | these | farms | is | computed | as | the | difference | between | the | nutrient | content | in | inputs | piglets | and | feed | and | the | nutrient | content | in | the | marketable | output | pork | Frisch | 1965 | Førsund | 2008 | and | Murty | et | al | 2012 | view | the | firm | 's | technology | as | resulting | from | the | interaction | of | several | separate | sub | technologies | The | original | conceptualization | is | credited | to | Frisch | 1965 | and | can | be | briefly | described | as | follows | Production | among | multiple | products | is | governed | by | distinct | production | relations | each | of | which | is | independent | of | the | other | Each | of | these | product | relations | can | involve | both | multiple | inputs | and | multiple | outputs | Førsund | 2008 | shows | how | such | a | system | can | be | extended | to | modeling | the | interaction | between | both | multiple | intended | outputs | and | unintended | by | products | in | Frisch | 's | 1965 | framework | Murty | et | al | 2012 | extend | the | approach | further | by | introducing | the | notion | of | by | production | in | their | empirical | analysis | of | electric | plants | two | sub | technologies | are | considered | one | that | models | electricity | generation | and | another | that | models | sulfur | dioxide | and | nitrogen | oxide | emissions

While | the | production | economics | literature | has | heavily | debated | the | proper | specification | of | technologies | that | involve | both | intended | and | unintended | outputs | less | attention | has | been | paid | to | the | incorporation | of | the | fundamentally | stochastic | nature | of | production | into | efficiency | and | productivity | analyses | Even | the | stochastic | frontier | model | is | typically | grounded | on | the | assumption | that | the | underlying | technology | is | non | stochastic | In | industries | such | as | agriculture | where | uncertainty | is | more | the | norm | than | the | exception | this | can | lead | to | biased | efficiency | and | productivity | estimates | because | effects | due | to | uncertainty | can | either | be | attributed | to | productivity | or | efficiency | differences | For | example | a | bad | production | outcome | due | to | a | stochastic | factor | beyond | farmers | control | may | be | misconstrued | as | an | inefficient | production | choice | An | important | challenge | in | production | economics | is | thus | to | appropriately | model | the | stochastic | environment | under | which | production | takes | place

The | state | contingent | approach | proposed | by | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 1998 | and | 2000 | and | extended | by | the | theory | developed | by | Debreu | 1959 | is | based | on | the | assumption | that | production | under | uncertainty | can | be | represented | by | differentiating | outputs | according | to | the | state | of | nature | in | which | they | are | realized | This | leads | to | a | stochastic | technology | based | on | a | state | contingent | input | correspondence | Under | conventional | representations | of | stochastic | technologies | input | output | relationships | are | studied | conditional | on | the | realized | state | of | nature | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2000 | have | shown | that | while | these | representations | are | an | extension | of | the | conventional | non | stochastic | technology | and | can | be | easily | empirically | implemented | they | impose | relevant | restrictions | For | example | non | substitutability | between | state | contingent | outputs | is | imposed | that | is | it | is | assumed | that | producers | can | only | respond | to | random | shocks | by | modifying | their | input | bundle | but | not | by | re | allocating | statecontingent | outputs | This | representation | is | known | as | the | output | cubical | technology | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2000 | and | has | been | shown | to | potentially | lead | to | important | biases | in | efficiency | estimates | O'Donnell | et | al | 2010

Ex | ante | measures | of | the | random | variables | are | required | to | overcome | the | output | cubicality | assumption | Since | past | efforts | have | been | focused | on | collecting | ex | post | production | data | ex | ante | measures | are | usually | unavailable | Our | work | is | innovative | in | that | it | relies | on | data | collected | by | means | of | a | survey | that | elicited | information | on | ex | ante | state | contingent | outputs | When | such | measures | are | on | hand | the | methods | used | to | study | deterministic | technologies | can | be | easily | applied | to | evaluate | state | contingent | technologies | By | using | the | Arrow | Debreu | Savage | framework | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2000 | show | that | in | the | presence | of | risk | the | firm | 's | cost | and | input | demand | functions | depend | on | the | outputs | in | all | possible | states | of | nature | Further | recognition | that | individuals | with | monotonic | preferences | minimize | cost | permits | the | evaluation | of | production | decisions | independent | of | any | specific | assumption | on | risk | attitudes

Despite | the | relevance | of | state | contingent | techniques | there | are | very | few | empirical | applications | based | on | this | methodology | e.g. | O'Donnell | and | Griffiths | 2006 | Chavas | 2008 | Serra | et | al | 2010 | The | list | of | applications | of | the | state | contingent | technologies | to | the | analysis | of | environmental | analysis | is | certainly | much | shorter | In | fact | we | are | only | aware | of | the | analysis | by | Serra | et | al | 2014 | who | develop | a | model | based | on | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | proposal | to | study | nitrate | pollution | efficiency | for | a | sample | of | Catalan | farms | The | stochastic | production | conditions | are | allowed | for | by | means | of | the | state | contingent | technology | This | article | is | a | companion | paper | to | Serra | et | al | 2014 | and | focuses | on | studying | pesticide | pollution | efficiency | We | extend | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | and | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | 's | methods | by | incorporating | the | stochastic | nature | of | production | by | means | of | state | contingent | methods | We | compare | the | results | derived | from | both | approaches

Recently | traditional | TE | measures | have | been | extended | to | integrate | pollution | considerations | Late | developments | within | this | literature | have | stressed | the | need | to | consider | the | materials | balance | condition | in | order | to | provide | sound | measures | of | farms | environmental | performance | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | proposal | based | on | this | principle | is | extended | to | allow | for | the | stochastic | conditions | of | production | Results | are | compared | with | the | ones | derived | from | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | model

Consider | a | firm | that | uses | a | vector | of | k | 1 | 2 | K | inputs

which | is | assumed | to | be | composed | by | a | vector | of | nonpolluting | inputs | x | np | and | polluting | inputs | x | p | to | produce | a | state | contingent | output | y | y | 1 | y | S | R | S | The | set | of | states | of | nature | is | represented | by | V | 1 | 2 | S | and | y | s | represents | the | output | realized | under | state | of | nature | s. | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2000 | and | Rasmussen | 2003 | define | state | allocable | inputs | as | inputs | that | ex | ante | can | be | allocated | to | different | states | of | nature | Due | to | data | limitations | and | the | characteristics | of | our | sample | farms | inputs | are | not | assumed | to | be | state | allocable | Having | said | that | it | is | important | to | note | that | even | if | no | information | on | input | allocation | across | states | is | available | application | of | the | state | contingent | method | involves | substantial | improvements | in | identifying | efficiency | relative | to | the | conventional | nonstochastic | DEA | approach | The | advantages | of | applying | the | state | contingent | method | are | mainly | the | following | 1 | It | recognizes | that | outputs | are | conditional | upon | states | of | nature | 2 | It | allows | for | output | substitution | across | states | of | nature | 3 | It | generalizes | the | output | cubical | assumption | implicit | in | stochastic | production | functions

The | output | cubicality | or | fixed | ouput | proportions | assumption | has | been | shown | by | previous | research | Chavas | 2008 | to | fail | when | empirically | tested

Under | the | wrong | output | cubicality | assumption | an | ex | post | analysis | of | output | neglects | the | effects | of | a | priori | input | choices | on | the | output | distribution | across | states | of | nature | This | has | at | least | two | implications | Chavas | 2008 | First | if | agents | are | not | neutral | to | risk | focusing | on | ex | post | output | fails | to | capture | the | role | of | risk | management | on | input | choice | Second | it | does | fail | to | provide | complete | characterization | of | the | stochastic | technology | the | first | moment | is | not | enough | to | represent | the | output | distribution | In | the | presence | of | risk | proper | input | use | requires | information | on | the | marginal | product | of | inputs | under | different | states | of | nature | This | information | is | provided | by | the | state | contingent | approach | O'Donnell | and | Griffiths | 2006

The | feasible | production | set | under | the | state | contingent | approach | and | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | proposal | T | C | can | be | derived | as | follows

where | the | production | technology | is | defined | to | be | convex | non | increasing | in | inputs | non | decreasing | in | outputs | and | strongly | disposable | in | inputs | and | outputs | Superindex | C | is | used | throughout | the | paper | to | represent | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | model | and | scores | Let | z | R | S | represent | a | surplus | measure | calculated | using | a | materials | balance | equation | which | is | specified | as | a | linear | function | of | input | and | output | vectors

where | a | and | b | represent | vectors | of | known | non | negative | constants | The | optimization | problem | seeks | to | determine | the | optimal | combination | of | inputs | for | a | given | amount | of | output | that | minimizes | the | amount | of | the | surplus | pollution | caused | in | the | production | process | This | produces | a | new | environmental | efficiency | measure | that | can | be | decomposed | into | technical | and | allocative | components | in | a | similar | manner | to | the | conventional | cost | efficiency | decomposition

Under | the | assumption | that | the | output | vector | y | is | fixed | or | that | the | output | vector | is | not | capable | of | converting | the | polluting | inputs | into | a | usable | form | 2 | that | is | when | b | equals | the | zero | vector | the | first | component | of | the | surplus | in | equation | 2 | will | be | minimized | when | the | aggregate | pollutant | content | of | inputs | M | a | x | is | minimized | For | a | given | vector | of | k | 1 | 2 | K | pollution | contents | a | R | K | the | minimum | pollution | associated | with | producing | a | specified | amount | of | output | can | be | expressed | as

3

We | denote | x | e | as | the | solution | to | the | minimization | problem | in | equation | 3 | while | a | x | e | and | a | x | represent | the | minimum | and | the | observed | environmental | damage | respectively | Following | Farrell | 1957 | the | technically | efficient | input | vector | x | t | can | be | determined | by | solving | the | following | optimization | problem

where | u | is | a | scalar | that | takes | a | value | between | zero | and | one | x | t | is | determined | by | x | t | ux | and | the | corresponding | amount | of | pollution | can | be | approximated | by | a | x | t | Under | the | state | contingent | approach | to | modeling | risk | the | production | function | is | transformed | from | an | ex | post | to | an | ex | ante | representation | of | technology | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2000 | Since | ex | ante | production | is | conditional | upon | the | state | of | nature | each | ex | post | output | quantity | has | a | multivariate | ex | ante | representation | y | y | 1 | y | S | R | S | The | increase | in | the | output | vector | size | under | the | state | contingent | approach | may | bring | dimensionality | issues | that | are | specially | relevant | under | SFA | as | the | number | of | parameters | to | be | estimated | grows | substantially | Further | ex | ante | statecontingent | outputs | tend | to | be | strongly | correlated | with | each | other | Chavas | 2008 | which | is | associated | with | potential | multicollinearity | issues | in | econometric | model | estimation | Overcoming | multicollinearity | problems | in | parametric | approaches | usually | involves | working | with | a | reduced | version | of | the | actual | state | space

Following | Fa | ¨re | et | al | 1994 | the | DEA | linear | programming | model | to | assess | input | oriented | TE | C | levels | equation | 4 | can | be | expressed | as

where | N | represents | the | number | of | farms | As | noted | u | is | a | scalar | that | takes | values | between | 0 | and | 1 | with | ux | i | being | the | technically | efficient | vector | of | inputs | x | i | and | y | i | represent | the | input | and | output | vector | for | farm | i | while | X | and | Y | are | input | and | output | data | for | all | farms | in | the | sample | Further | l | is | a | Nx1 | vector | of | constants | and | the | constraint | N1 | l | 1 | is | included | to | allow | for | variable | returns | to | scale | VRS | Efficiency | scores | derived | under | VRS | are | compared | with | those | obtained | under | constant | returns | to | scale | CRS | A | farm | is | operating | at | optimal | size | only | when | CRS | and | VRS | scores | are | equal | Differences | in | the | CRS | and | VRS | scores | for | a | particular | firm | indicate | the | existence | of | scale | inefficiencies | The | EE | measure | EE | C | proposed | by | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | is | expressed | as | a | ratio | of | minimum | pollution | over | observed | pollution | as

where | EE | C | takes | a | value | between | zero | and | one | the | latter | indicating | that | the | firm | is | fully | environmentally | efficient | The | EE | C | scores | for | observation | i | equation | 6 | using | the | DEA | method | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | are | obtained | from | the | following | minimization | problem

where | g | is | a | Nx1 | vector | of | constants | According | to | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | environmental | inefficiencies | are | caused | both | by | technical | inefficiencies | that | imply | an | excessive | use | of | polluting | inputs | and | by | allocative | inefficiencies | involving | an | inappropriate | input | mix | given | the | observed | a | vector | Hence | EE | C | is | decomposed | into | two | components | TE | C | and | environmental | allocative | efficiency | EAE | C | as | follows

Allocative | efficiency | is | thus | defined | as | the | ratio | of | minimum | pollution | to | the | amount | of | pollution | generated | by | the | technically | efficient | input | vector | All | these | efficiency | measures | TE | C | EE | C | and | EAE | C | adopt | a | value | ranging | from | zero | to | one | and | can | be | related | through | the | following | expression

As | noted | above | apart | from | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | another | innovative | proposal | to | assess | environmental | efficiency | is | the | one | by | Murty | et | al | 2012 | that | views | a | firm | 's | technology | as | the | resulting | interaction | of | several | separate | sub | technologies | By | extending | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | approach | to | a | consideration | of | state | contingent | production | the | production | technology | can | be | defined | as

where | superindex | M | is | an | indicator | of | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | technology | This | technology | is | assumed | to | be | composed | by | several | sub | technologies | the | first | of | which | governs | the | production | of | intended | outputs | T | Y | x | y | x | can | produce | y | while | the | second | governs | the | production | of | pollution | T | Z | x | z | x | can | produce | z | The | overall | technology | is | the | intersection | of | these | two | feasible | production | sets

Though | a | generalization | of | research | results | is | difficult | to | make | and | data | and | methodologies | used | by | different | analyses | are | rather | heterogeneous | damages | derived | from | pesticide | use | are | found | to | be | one | of | the | most | relevant | agriculture | related | externalities | This | study | focuses | on | pollution | derived | from | pesticide | use | In | line | with | Morse | et | al | 2006 | Wossink | and | Denaux | 2007 | and | de | Koeijer | et | al | 2002 | we | build | an | index | of | pesticide | contamination | that | accounts | for | the | amount | of | pesticide | applied | and | its | toxicity | Through | a | farm | level | survey | we | collected | detailed | information | on | the | quantities | of | active | ingredients | applied | through | herbicides | fungicides | and | insecticides | The | total | quantity | of | active | ingredients | expressed | in | liters | was | considered | as | a | polluting | input | As | is | well | known | different | active | ingredients | have | different | environmental | and | health | effects | To | derive | a | single | measure | of | pesticide | pollution | we | used | a | weighting | procedure | 3 | While | different | indices | have | been | elaborated | to | measure | the | impacts | of | different | active | ingredients | on | the | environment | and | on | animal | and | human | health | they | usually | cover | a | limited | number | of | ingredients | The | Acceptable | Daily | Intake | a | r | obtained | from | the | Footprint | 2012 | dataset | is | the | only | index | covering | the | full | range | of | active | ingredients | used | by | our | sample | farms | Subindex | r | 1 | P | indexes | the | different | active | ingredients | and | a | r | measures | the | quantity | of | active | ingredients | that | can | be | daily | ingested | over | a | lifetime | without | implying | a | significant | health | risk | for | humans | 4 | This | index | is | usually | measured | in | mg | per | kilos | of | body | weight | per | day | mg | kgbw/ | day | The | vector | of | a | r | 's | can | be | represented | as | a= | a | 1 | a | 2 | a | P | 14

while | the | vector | of | weights | applied | to | each | active | ingredient | is | expressed | as

The | state | contingent | model | Quiggin | and | Chambers | 2006 | is | defined | in | terms | of | state | contingent | outputs | that | are | chosen | ex | ante | but | produced | ex | post | To | define | the | ex | ante | output | vector | we | use | a | particularly | unique | crosssectional | data | set | that | was | collected | from | a | sample | designed | to | elicit | measures | of | both | ex | ante | stochastic | intended | outputs | and | unintended | outputs | pollution | and | damage | to | human | health | A | questionnaire | was | distributed | among | 189 | agricultural | holdings | specialized | in | the | production | of | cereals | oilseeds | and | protein | COP | crops | The | survey | was | conducted | during | the | planting | season | in | 2011 | and | includes | detailed | information | on | planned | input | use | We | also | obtained | data | on | ex | ante | outputs | for | three | alternative | states | of | nature | bad | normal | and | ideal | growing | conditions | y | y | 1 | y | 2 | y | 3

Eliciting | ex | ante | output | information | is | not | straightforward | and | responses | can | be | affected | by | subjective | beliefs | regarding | crop | yield | distribution | Subjective | opinions | about | what | characterizes | a | bad | normal | or | ideal | crop | yield | can | produce | biased | responses | To | reduce | subjectivity | one | could | provide | farmers | with | detailed | information | on | each | crop | growing | scenario | rainfall | temperature | frost | etc | This | however | would | increase | survey | complexity | and | cost | as | a | full | characterization | of | crop | growing | scenarios | would | require | the | provision | of | a | relevant | amount | of | data | during | the | interview | For | example | providing | the | number | of | frost | days | during | the | growing | season | would | render | an | incomplete | picture | if | not | accompanied | by | the | distribution | of | these | days | over | time | Incomplete | scenarios | would | lead | to | highly | inaccurate | responses

Final | survey | design | was | a | trade | off | between | complexity | and | subjectivity | and | was | conditional | upon | feedback | from | technicians | from | Unio | de | Pagesos | the | largest | farmer | 's | association | in | Catalonia | which | was | in | charge | of | administering | the | survey | Qualified | technicians | from | this | institution | recommended | obtaining | point | estimates | of | yields | under | bad | y | 1 | normal | y | 2 | and | ideal | y | 3 | growing | conditions | as | the | most | practical | approach | to | eliciting | information | on | ex | ante | yields | Yields | under | normal | conditions | are | usually | a | reference | representing | average | yields | over | a | sufficiently | long | period | of | time | and | their | identification | is | key | for | respondents | Once | these | are | identified | it | is | relatively | easy | for | farmers | to | provide | yield | data | under | bad | and | ideal | conditions | Realized | output | data | were | obtained | by | contacting | farms | at | the | end | of | the | season

Our | survey | obtains | ex | ante | output | information | based | on | subjective | notions | that | create | the | potential | for | identification | biases | Difficulties | inherent | in | obtaining | accurate | estimates | of | state | contingent | yields | are | comparable | to | the | hypothetical | bias | problem | in | contingent | valuation | analyses | which | leads | to | differences | in | values | drawn | up | under | a | hypothetical | and | a | real | setting | List | and | Shogren | 1998 | In | order | to | reduce | this | bias | calibration | techniques | have | been | proposed | some | of | which | involve | warning | survey | respondents | about | the | quality | of | the | responses | This | is | the | case | of | the | cheap | talk | technique | that | has | been | shown | to | reduce | unknowledgeable | respondents | bias | Cummings | and | Taylor | 1999 | List | 2001 | but | to | be | less | successful | with | experienced | respondents | List | 2001 | Lusk | 2003 | Our | respondents | had | 29 | years | of | experience | in | cultivating | arable | crops | and | thus | they | can | be | considered | as | experienced | The | fact | that | interviewers | were | technicians | from | Unio | de | Pagesos | who | know | the | farm | well | is | expected | to | have | reduced | farmers | incentives | to | provide | biased | responses | 5 | Unio | de | Pagesos | experts | were | consulted | regarding | the | possibility | of | allowing | inputs | to | be | allocated | to | different | states | of | nature | e.g. | efforts | allocated | to | flood | control | and | to | irrigation | facilities | These | experts | indicated | that | since | our | sample | farms | are | rain | fed | pesticides | and | fertilizers | are | the | inputs | that | offer | major | flexibility | to | be | allocated | across | different | states | of | nature | Regarding | the | use | of | pesticides | insecticides | and | herbicides | our | sample | farms | mainly | use | herbicides | and | the | quantities | applied | are | fairly | stable | over | time | and | are | based | on | recommendations | from | suppliers | and | extension | services | The | same | situation | applies | for | fertilizer | use | Sample | farms | nitrogen | input | use | estimates | have | been | compared | with | nitrogen | application | recommendations | made | by | the | Catalan | Government | and | the | Research | and | Technology | Food | and | Agriculture | Institute | IRTA | and | they | match | very | well | with | an | average | deviation | on | the | order | of | 6

Table | 2 | provides | summary | statistics | for | the | variables | used | in | the | analysis | Sample | farms | cultivate | on | average | 75 | hectares | This | is | above | the | national | and | the | EU | arable | crop | farms | average | which | are | approximately | 52 | and | 46 | hectares | respectively | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | FADN | 2012 | More | than | 95 | of | the | COP | area | is | devoted | to | wheat | 36 | and | barley | 60 | production | Sample | farms | dedicate | on | average | 552 | hours | mainly | unpaid | family | labor | to | COP | production | during | the | growing | season

Farmers | yield | expectations | depend | on | crop | growing | conditions | While | under | bad | conditions | COP | production | is | around | E31,000 | per | farm | average | output | under | ideal | conditions | is | on | the | order | of | E70,000 | Per | ha | statistics | suggest | that | our | sample | farms | are | more | intensive | than | both | national | and | EU | farms | The | value | of | COP | production | under | normal | conditions | E51,000 | almost | doubles | the | EU | farms | average | output | E28,000 | While | EU | and | national | farms | have | respectively | an | average | income | of | E627 | and | E428 | per | ha | E670 | per | ha | is | the | average | income | of | our | sample | farms | under | normal | growing | conditions | Machinery | and | buildings | used | by | sample | farms | amount | to | E134,000 | per | farm | or | E2,304 | per | ha | which | are | above | EU | and | national | average | investment | ratios | on | the | order | of | E1,497 | E | per | ha | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | 2012 | and | E536 | E | per | ha | respectively | While | sample | farms | cultivate | more | land | than | EU | arable | crop | farms | they | spend | less | money | on | fertilizer | than | the | latter | E5,315 | vs. | E9,279 | annually | The | total | quantity | of | active | ingredients | used | by | our | sample | farms | is | on | average | on | the | order | of | 85 | liters | Expenses | in | pesticides | amount | to | E2,975 | which | is | below | the | EU | 's | average | crop | farms | E5,120 | Annual | expenses | in | seeds | and | energy | are | on | the | order | of | E3,866 | and | E4,913 | respectively

Table | 3 | indicates | that | efficiency | scores | are | reasonably | close | when | obtained | from | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | and | from | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | method | Technical | efficiency | estimates | are | virtually | identical | they | reflect | the | difference | between | the | two | methods | attributed | to | the | input | output | orientation | differences | between | the | two | methodologies | Environmental | efficiency | estimates | derived | from | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | method | are | on | average | 0.577 | higher | than | those | obtained | from | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | method | 0.420 | Hence | different | methodologies | yield | different | DEA | estimates | of | environmental | efficiency | The | histogram | presented | in | figure | 1 | which | shows | the | distribution | of | efficiency | scores | under | both | methods | suggests | a | bimodal | distribution | with | most | observations | located | in | the | extremes | 6 | The | remainder | of | the | analysis | focuses | on | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | approach | and | offers | more | optimistic | estimates | of | the | magnitude | of | environmental | inefficiencies | Table | 4 | compares | efficiency | ratings | under | VRS | and | CRS | assumptions | in | order | to | provide | insights | on | whether | sample | farms | are | operating | at | their | optimal | scale | Results | yield | mean | TE | C | scores | on | the | order | of | 0.929 | and | 0.866 | under | VRS | and | CRS | respectively | suggesting | that | sample | farms | could | use | on | average | 7 | 13 | fewer | inputs | to | produce | the | same | current | output | level | Differences | between | the | CRS | and | VRS | scores | for | a | particular | firm | are | due | to | scale | inefficiencies | More | specifically | about | half | of | the | farms | are | not | operating | at | their | optimal | scale | Returns | to | scale | are | studied | to | find | overwhelming | support | for | increasing | returns | to | scale | that | is | current | farms | size | is | smaller | than | their | optimum | size | The | assumption | of | VRS | is | thus | more | adequate | Under | VRS | more | than | 70 | of | the | observations | have | efficiency | ratings | greater | than | 0.90 | showing | relatively | high | performance | levels

Environmental | efficiency | ratings | imply | substantial | scope | to | reduce | chemical | input | use | leaving | current | output | levels | unaltered | This | will | alleviate | the | negative | environmental | impacts | of | chemical | inputs | contamination | of |  | surface | and | groundwater | loss | of | biodiversity | etc | If | sample | farms | were | environmentally | efficient | around | 26 | of | the | currently | used | pesticides | insecticides | and | herbicides | would | be | avoided | around | 0.29 | liters | on | a | per | hectare | basis | for | our | sample | farms | 7 | This | reduction | in | pollution | levels | would | take | place | at | no | cost | and | would | not | require | the | adoption | of | pollution | abatement | technologies | A | more | rational | input | use | would | suffice | Previous | research | using | different | methodologies | and/or | assessing | different | case | studies | has | derived | different | results | For | example | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | obtained | higher | EE | ratings | on | the | order | of | 0.843 | for | his | sample | of | pigfinishing | farms | in | Belgium | Reinhard | and | Thijssen | 2000 | found | nitrogen | efficiency | levels | around | 0.56 | for | a | sample | of | Dutch | dairy | farms | Asmild | and | Hougaard | 2006 | who | assessed | the | EE | of | a | sample | of | Danish | pig | farms | obtained | much | lower | EE | levels | 34 | -56 | Serra | et | al | 2014 | obtained | inefficiency | levels | of | around | 80 | for | nitrogen | pollution | for | the | same | sample | of | farms

In | order | to | show | the | extent | to | which | efficiency | estimates | might | be | biased | as | a | result | of | ignoring | stochastic | production | conditions | ex | post | estimates | are | also | presented | in | table | 4 | and | confirm | O'Donnell | et | al | 's | 2010 | conclusion | that | ex | post | output | observations | do | not | soundly | represent | the | stochastic | production | environment | in | which | production | takes | place | and | yield | downward | biased | technical | efficiency | measures

To | study | the | association | between | efficiency | measures | TE | EE | and | EAE | we | use | the | Spearman | 's | correlation | coefficient | which | suggests | a | high | and | positive | correlation | between | all | efficiency | measures | table | 5 | Hence | environmentally | efficient | farms | tend | to | be | more | allocative | and | technically | efficient | Better | agri | environmental | performance | is | associated | with | good | agricultural | practices | supporting | the | notion | that | an | efficient | use | of | chemical | inputs | improves | both | environmental | and | technical | performance | As | opposed | to | previous | studies | that | found | an | adverse | effect | of | environmental | regulations | on | productivity | Fa | ¨re | et | al | 2001 | the | high | correlation | between | TE | and | EE | for | our | sample | farms | implies | complementarity | between | economic | and | environmental | sustainability

As | an | attempt | to | identify | the | reasons | underlying | efficiency | scores | of | sample | farms | a | Tobit | model | is | estimated | for | technical | allocative | and | environmental | efficiency | ratings | The | Tobit | model | has | been | employed | extensively | in | previous | research | as | a | method | to | model | efficiency | scores | as | a | censored | variable | taking | values | bounded | between | zero | and | one | Weersink | et | al | 1990 | Greene | 1991 | Bjurek | et | al | 1992 | Oum | and | Yu | 1994 | Chilingerian | 1995 | Bravo | Ureta | and | Pinheiro | 1997 | Ruggiero | and | Vitaliano | 1999 | Latruffe | et | al | 2004 | Bravo | Ureta | et | al | 2007 | Our | Tobit | analysis | which | is | restricted | by | data | availability | is | specified | as | follows

where | eff | i | is | farm | level | efficiency | g | mi | are | variables | that | may | influence | efficiency | c | 0 | and | c | m | are | parameters | to | be | estimated | and | 1 | i | is | the | error | term | assumed | to | be | normally | distributed | with | zero | mean | and | finite | variance | s | 2 | 1 | Limited | to | data | availability | and | following | previous | literature | Tzouvelekas | et | al | 2002 | Karagiannis | 2006 | Lambarraa | et | al | 2007 | Madau | 2007 | Guesmi | et | al | 2012 | DEA | efficiency | scores | are | regressed | against | different | explanatory | variables | including | information | on | farm | location | subsidies | and | farmers | socio | economic | characteristics | potentially | related | to | the | performance | of | Catalan | farmers

Since | our | sample | farms | are | mainly | located | in | two | different | provinces | of | Catalonia | namely | Barcelona | and | Lleida | g | 1 | is | defined | as | a | dummy | variable | equal | to | one | if | farms | are | sited | in | Barcelona | and | zero | in | Lleida | while | g | 2 | measures | the | age | of | the | farm | manager | Farmers | education | is | represented | by | g | 3 | which | is | equal | to | one | if | farmers | have | received | education | beyond | the | elementary | degree | and | zero | otherwise | We | define | g | 4 | as | the | number | of | people | in | the | agricultural | household | Non | agricultural | income | expressed | in | Euros | is | reflected | in | g | 5 | Subsidies | received | by | farmers | under | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | CAP | are | expressed | in | Euros | and | included | in | g | 6 | Subsidies | have | been | shown | to | have | either | a | positive | or | negative | impact | on | farmers | technical | performance | Hennessy | 1998 | Ciaian | and | Swinnen | 2009 | While | subsidies | are | expected | to | have | a | positive | impact | on | efficiency | when | they | help | farmers | to | invest | in | new | technologies | they | may | negatively | affect | performance | when | representing | an | income | safety | net | While | several | studies | have | often | assessed | the | effect | of | subsidies | on | technical | performance | its | effect | on | environmental | performance | has | not | yet | been | studied | As | is | well | known | the | cross | compliance | mechanism | of | the | CAP | links | EU | support | to | farmers | with | different | standards | of | environmental | care | and | public | and | plant | health | and | animal | health | and | welfare | Cross | compliance | reduces | support | to | those | farmers | infringing | upon | EU | laws | regarding | the | environment | public | and | animal | health | animal | welfare | or | land | management | Cross | compliance | further | includes | a | series | of | rules | on | good | agricultural | and | environmental | conditions | While | most | of | the | regulations | that | farms | have | to | comply | with | do | not | vary | at | the | local | level | some | do | This | is | mainly | the | case | of | the | nitrates | directive | whose | implementation | is | conditional | upon | whether | the | agricultural | holding | is | located | in | a | nitrate | vulnerable | zone | NVZ | or | not | It | is | worth | exploring | whether | this | has | any | impact | on | efficiency | levels | Consistently | g | 7 | is | defined | as | a | dummy | variable | that | identifies | whether | the | agricultural | holding | is | located | in | a | nitrate | vulnerable | zone | or | not | 32 | of | our | sample | farms | are | located | in | these | areas | Table | 2 | presents | summary | statistics | for | regressors | in | the | Tobit | model

Tobit | results | for | the | TE | C | EE | C | and | EAE | C | measures | are | presented | in | table | 6 | The | likelihood | ratio | test | is | significant | at | the | 1 | level | for | each | regression | indicating | that | all | variables | considered | are | jointly | significant | in | explaining | technical | environmental | and | allocative | efficiency | Non | agricultural | activities | show | a | significant | negative | relationship | with | efficiency | suggesting | that | farmers | who | diversify | their | income | sources | by | conducting | non | agricultural | activities | tend | to | display | poorer | technical | environmental | and | allocative | performance | levels | Subsidies | received | under | the | CAP | program | have | a | significant | positive | relationship | with | efficiency | This | can | be | explained | by | both | the | cross | compliance | of | the | CAP | and | the | extensification | that | results | from | decoupling | Hennessy | 1998 | Moro | and | Sckokai | 1999 | Serra | et | al | 2005 | Sckokai | and | Moro | 2006 | The | latter | implies | a | decline | in | input | use | which | is | likely | to | bring | a | reduction | in | the | quantity | of | unintended | pollution | derived | from | farming | activities | Serra | et | al | 2005 | for | example | conclude | that | decoupling | farm | payments | may | lead | to | a | reduction | in | the | application | of | crop | protection | inputs

A | farm | 's | location | influences | its | technical | efficiency | but | not | its | environmental | and | allocative | efficiencies | Lleida | farms | are | found | to | be | more | technically | efficient | which | may | be | due | to | the | fact | that | they | are | much | bigger | on | average | than | Barcelona | farms | average | utilized | agricultural | area | is | 99.83 | ha | 57.15 | ha | for | Lleida | Barcelona | farms | respectively | Results | show | that | location | in | NVZ | farmers | age | and | education | levels | do | not | exert | a | statistically | significant | impact | on | efficiency | levels | Finally | the | household | size | has | a | positive | and | significant | influence | on | efficiency | Farmers | with | a | large | family | size | tend | to | be | more | efficient | A | large | family | size | may | indicate | the | presence | of | descendents | children | that | could | increase | economic | and | environmental | concerns | spurring | farmers | to | become | more | efficient | technically | to | ensure | stronger | economic | sustainability | and | environmentally | to | ensure | environmental | sustainability

In | order | to | draw | stronger | policy | conclusions | from | our | research | results | we | hypothesize | a | redistribution | of | CAP | subsidies | in | favor | of | the | farms | displaying | higher | technical | or | environmental | efficiency | levels | In | table | 7 | summary | statistics | are | presented | for | farms | with | technical | efficiency | at | or | above | the | third | quartile | For | comparison | purposes | descriptive | figures | for | farms | with | performance | levels | below | the | first | quartile | are | also | presented | Current | subsidy | distribution | mainly | benefits | low | performance | and | rather | small | farms | run | by | older | farmers | who | have | strong | dependence | on |  | non | agricultural | income | A | redistribution | of | subsidies | according | to | technical | efficiency | would | help | bigger | farms | and | younger | and | more | educated | managers | who | are | less | dependent | on | non | agricultural | income | sources | Further | these | farms | are | found | to | be | less | intensive | in | terms | of | pesticide | use | on | a | per | hectare | basis | and | thus | they | have | higher | degrees | of | environmental | sustainability | The | proportion | of | farms | that | are | located | in | NVZ | is | higher | in | the | high | efficiency | quartile | than | those | in | the | other | group | Table | 8 | shows | the | characteristics | of | farms | below | the | first | and | above | the | third | quartile | of | environmental | efficiency | Once | more | it | can | be | observed | that | a | redistribution | of | subsidies | would | also | benefit | large | farms | managed | by | younger | farmers | with | less | reliance | on | non | farm | economic | activities | as | a | source | of | income | In | short | for | our | sample | farms | any | redistribution | scheme | based | on | farm | performance | would | have | strong | implications | for | the | agricultural | sector | Any | scheme | would | probably | motivate | a | structural | adjustment | in | favor | of | larger | and | less | intensive | agricultural | holdings | that | given | their | higher | performance | both | at | the | technical | and | environmental | levels | are | likely | to | be | more | competitive | in | the | market | However | whether | the | redistribution | criteria | is | based | on | environmental | or | technical | issues | will | not | have | substantially | different | implications

The | productive | efficiency | literature | has | paid | very | little | attention | to | environmental | performance | issues | Growing | social | and | political | concerns | for | the | environmental | impacts | of | agriculture | make | it | necessary | to | study | environmental | and | technical | performance | using | robust | methodologies | that | enable | scientists | to | derive | reliable | indicators | Two | recent | pathbreaking | proposals | include | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | and | Murty | et | al | 2012 | Coelli | et | al | 2007 | proposed | including | pollution | into | conventional | productive | efficiency | measures | by | using | the | materials | balance | concept | Murty | et | al | 2012 | model | polluting | technologies | as | a | composition | of | two | sub | technologies | an | intended | output | and | a | residual | generation | technology

This | study | contributes | to | the | literature | by | extending | Coelli | et | al | 's | 2007 | and | Murty | et | al | 's | 2012 | proposals | to | allow | for | the | stochastic | environment | in | which | production | takes | place | The | extension | is | based | on | state | contingent | methods | Chambers | and | Quiggin | 2000 | Furthermore | to | show | to | what | extent | efficiency | estimates | might | be | biased | when | allowing | for | risk | a | comparison | between | ex | ante | and | ex | post | results | is | carried | out

The | analysis | is | conducted | on | a | sample | of | 189 | Catalan | farms | specialized | in | cereals | oilseeds | and | protein | crop | production | To | our | knowledge | this | is | the | first | empirical | application | that | assesses | pesticide | pollution | efficiency | using | both | the | materials | balance | and | state | contingent | frameworks | Further | our | work | is | innovative | in | that | it | relies | on | data | collected | by | means | of | a | survey | that | elicited | information | on | ex | ante | state | contingent | outputs

Empirical | findings | suggest | that | our | sample | farms | on | average | reach | technical | efficiency | scores | of | 93 | and | thus | that | they | can | reduce | input | use | by | 7 | while | leaving | output | levels | unaltered | Environmental | efficiency | scores | differ | depending | on | the | methodology | used | and | indicate | ample | scope | for | improving | environmental | performance | and | reducing | pesticide | use | and | pollution | Our | research | results | further | show | that | ignoring | the | stochastic | conditions | of | production | yields | downward | biased | efficiency | estimates | A | farm | household | 's | nonfarm | income | and | family | size | are | found | to | be | significant | determinants | of | farm | technical | environmental | and | allocative | efficiency | ratings | Farm | location | influences | technical | performance

Based | on | our | empirical | findings | some | important | policy | implications | both | for | firm | management | decisions | and | policy | design | are | derived | Those | variables | with | higher | marginal | impacts | on | efficiency | should | be | the | ones | receiving | further | attention | by | farm | managers | and | policy | makers | We | find | specialization | in | farm | activities | to | the | detriment | of | non | farm | income | to | improve | efficiency | ratings | Thus | any | policy | promoting | farmer | specialization | would | increase | the | sustainability | of | the | farm | sector | This | could | be | achieved | by | promoting | a | restructuring | of | the | sector | in | favor | of | bigger | farms | capable | of | providing | enough | income | for | the | farm | family | Though | subsidies | have | often | been | criticized | for | reducing | economic | agents | responsiveness | to | changing | market | conditions | and | increasing | inefficiencies | our | results | support | the | opposite

For | our | sample | farms | any | CAP | subsidy | redistribution | scheme | based | on | farm | performance | would | have | strong | implications | for | the | agricultural | sector | Any | such | scheme | would | probably | motivate | a | structural | adjustment | in | favor | of | bigger | and | less | intensive | agricultural | holdings | that | given | their | higher | performance | levels | both | at | the | technical | and | environmental | levels | are | likely | to | be | more | competitive | in | the | market | However | whether | the | redistribution | criteria | is | environmental | or | technical | will | not | have | substantially | different | implications | This | is | due | to | the | fact | that | environmental | and | technical | efficiency | are | strongly | interrelated | for | our | sample | of | farms | In | other | words | the | efficient | use | of | chemical | inputs | improves | both | environmental | and | technical | performance
