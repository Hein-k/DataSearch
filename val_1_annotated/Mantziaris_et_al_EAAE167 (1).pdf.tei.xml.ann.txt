This | article | studies | the | potential | of | three | perennial | energy | crops | miscanthus | arundo | and | poplar | to | play | such | a | role | in | the | region | of | Karditsa | Greece | The | relevant | policy | mix | is | analysed | discussed | and | outlined | as | a | nexus | of | interrelated | incentives | provided | by | policy | makers | and | the | market | Supply | curves | for | different | energy | crops | can | be | used | as | a | decision | making | tool | by | all | interested | parties | within | a | biomass | oriented | supply | chain | biomass | producers | can | use | them | to | decide | on | the | economic | feasibility | and | efficiency | of | a | suggested | energy | crop | while | industrial | players | may | use | them | to | determine | contract | prices | that | ensure | long | term | availability | of | inputs | For | the | purpose | of | energy | crops | supply | curves | estimation | a | sequential | linear | programming | model | is | developed | which | takes | into | consideration | the | deployment | of | farms | decisions | in | time | illustrating | crop | mix | and | economic | indicators | in | the | medium | term | As | biomass | price | increases | arundo | cultivation | reveals | significant | possibility | of | expansion | compared | to | miscanthus | and | poplar | On | the | other | hand | durum | wheat | and | set | aside | are | decreased | significantly | Aggregate | biomass | supply | curve | moves | upwards | over | the | studied | years

The | economic | crisis | of | Greece | may | indeed | generate | opportunities | and | challenges | for | the | renewable | energy | One | such | opportunity | has | been | the | increased | demand | for | renewable | lowercost | energy | particularly | from | households | which | can | not | meet | their | heating | needs | due | to | the | very | high | price | of | electricity | and | oil | used | in | conventional | heating | systems | Mavridis | 2015 | Toka | 2015 | Demand | for | wood | pellets | has | increased | considerably | and | many | households | abandon | their | old | oil | consuming | heaters | in | favour | of | heating | systems | based | on | pellets | Ketikidis | et | al | 2013 | Yet | Greece | is | a | net | importer | of | pellets | and | thus | increased | demand | threatens | to | make | trade | deficit | even | higher | than | the | current | one | imports | 20.9 | thousand | tons | of | pellets | and | exports | only | 0.67 | thousand | tons | Mavridis | 2015 | Toka | 2015 | Thus | it | is | extremely | important | to | assess | the | potential | of | local | bioenergy | supply | chains | that | use | locally | grown | perennial | energy | crops | as | their | main | input | to | provide | a | source | of | income | to | farmers | The | studied | energy | crops | are | miscanthus | arundo | and | poplar | and | their | dry | matter | biomass | is | mainly | intended | for | the | production | of | solid | biofuels | e.g. | pellets | Additionally | these | energy | crops | can | be | cultivated | in | low | input | land | e.g. | arundo | and | miscanthus | in | non | irrigated | land | and | poplar | in | land | without | fertilization | Perennials | have | lower | pesticide | and | fertilizer | requirements | so | they | can | appear | more | attractive | to | farmers | than | annual | crops | Thus | the | substitution | of | perennial | energy | crops | for | conventional | crops | can | have | a | beneficial | effect | in | Greek | regions | like | Thessaly | facing | nitrate | pollution | issues | Supply | curves | for | different | energy | crops | can | be | used | as | a | decision | making | tool | by | all | interested | parties | within | a | biomass | oriented | supply | chain | biomass | producers | can | use | them | to | decide | on | the | economic | feasibility | and | efficiency | of | a | suggested | energy | crop | while | industrial | players | may | use | them | to | determine | contract | prices | that | ensure | long | term | availability | of | inputs | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017a

The | EU | RES | Directive | RED | 2009/28 | EC | lays | out | a | roadmap | for | all | member | states | to | increase | their | share | of | renewable | energy | consumption | to | 20 | of | total | energy | consumption | by | 2020 | According | to | 2011 | data | the | renewable | energy | sector | contributes | 13 | to | the | total | energy | consumption | in | EU-27 | AEBIOM | 2013 | Among | EU-27 | member | states | Estonia | is | a | good | example | of | an | achiever | as | regards | the | share | of | energy | from | renewable | sources | by | 2020 | On | the | contrary | the | UK | is | the | least | efficient | member | state | in | meeting | the | national | target | AEBIOM | 2013

Biomass | provides | already | the | largest | share | of | renewable | source | of | energy | globally | IEA | 2012 | The | role | and | contribution | of | energy | crops | to | the | bioenergy | sector | is | gradually | being | recognised | as | an | important | one | e.g. | Panoutsou | et | al | 2009 | Initial | concerns | over | food | supply | and | demand | and | the | reduction | of | arable | land | dedicated | to | food | production | were | mainly | associated | with | first | generation | biofuels

As | far | as | bioenergy | is | concerned | 2011 | statistics | show | that | it | represented | 68 | of | the | total | gross | inland | consumption | of | renewables | AEBIOM | 2013 | For | the | same | year | biomass | accounted | for | only | 8.4 | of | the | total | final | energy | consumption | in | EU-27 | However | for | some | countries | such | as | Estonia | Latvia | Finland | and | Sweden | biomass | participation | in | the | total | energy | consumption | exceeded | 25 | AEBIOM | 2013 | When | considering | energy | for | Heating | and | Cooling | biomass | holds | the | lion | 's | share | as | almost | 90 | of | renewable | heating | uses | a | biomass | related | source | AEBIOM | 2013

Energy | crops | in | EU-27 | can | be | classified | in | oilseed | rapeseed | sunflower | and | lignocellulosic | energy | crops | arundo | cardoon | hemp | miscanthus | poplar | reed | canary | grass | switch | grass | willow | The | area | covered | with | lignocellulosic | energy | crops | is | rather | limited | when | compared | to | that | covered | by | oilseed | crops | switch | grass | is | cultivated | in | 50 | thousand | hectares | willow | in | 36.48 | thousand | hectares | miscanthus | in | 19.67 | thousand | hectares | reed | canary | grass | in | 19.48 | thousand | hectares | poplar | in | 15.62 | thousand | hectares | arundo | in | 4 | thousand | hectares | cardoon | in | 0.5 | thousand | hectares | and | hemp | in | 0.44 | thousand | hectares | Table | 1

The | main | producing | countries | of | biomass | from | miscanthus | are | the | UK | 56 | France | 15.2 | Germany | 10.1 | and | Ireland | 10.1 | while | biomass | from | poplar | is | produced | mainly | in | Italy | 35.1 | and | Germany | 32 | Poland | 24.7 | and | Denmark | 15 | are | the | most | important | producers | of | biomass | from | willow | Switch | grass | reed | canary | grass | hemp | arundo | and | cardoon | biomass | are | mainly | produced | in | Romania | Finland | Sweden | Italy | and | Greece | respectively | Table | 1 | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017a |  | Current | projections | show | that | EU | consumption | will | continue | to | expand | Some | non | European | countries | such | as | Japan | and | South | Korea | are | foreseen | as | potentially | important | pellet | consumers | AEBIOM | 2013 | Consequently | there | is | a | considerable | margin | for | the | development | of | the | European | pellet | market | which | creates | increasing | demand | for | lignocellulosic | biomass

Up | until | 2009 | energy | crops | cultivated | in | Greece | for | commercial | exploitation | were | eligible | for | direct | land | subsidy | in | the | context | of | the | First | Pillar | of | Common | Agricultural | Policy | The | direct | payment | was | 45 | euros | ha | Since | 2010 | however | energy | crops | are | excluded | from | the | direct | payment | scheme | Further | the | 2013 | reform | of | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | CAP | moved | toward | decoupled | payments | partial | convergence | in | combination | with | greening | requirements | European | Commission | 2013 | As | a | result | the | historical | model | no | longer | applies | and | thus | subsidies | received | in | the | past | do | not | determine | subsidies | received | currently | or | in | the | future | Consequently | this | policy | may | affect | the | gross | income | of | various | farms | in | different | ways

Currently | in | Greece | there | is | no | government | driven | incentives | structure | in | place | that | could | lead | to | the | adoption | of | energy | crops | by | farmers | Nonetheless | market | deployment | policies | involving | establishment | subsidies | have | been | designed | and | implemented | to | influence | investment | decisions | by | the | industrial | partners | The | main | funding | mechanism | available | in | the | time | being | is | the | Partnership | Agreement | for | the | Development | Framework | 2014 | 2020 | PA | PA | seeks | to | mitigate | the | structural | weaknesses | that | proliferated | during | the | years | of | economic | crisis

Energy | crops | have | been | commercially | cultivated | in | Greece | since | 2005 | The | planting | rates | of | sunflower | rapeseed | and | cardoon | the | most | commonly | cultivated | crops | have | increased | significantly | over | these | years | also | due | to | the | implementation | of | contracting | farming | initiatives | from | the | industry | which | contribute | in | reducing | the | risk | for | farmers | and | provide | long | term | stability | Mitchel | et | al | 2006 | Table | 2 | So | far | there | have | not | been | any | commercial | cultivations | of | miscanthus | arundo | or | poplar

Concerning | the | analytical | tools | a | commonly | employed | methodology | is | the | use | of | variants | of | mathematical | programming | for | two | main | reasons | firstly | the | inadequacy | of | econometric | models | due | to | the | frequency | and | extent | of | policy | reforms | and | secondly | the | policy | shift | from | market | instruments | to | agri | environmental | and | multifunctional | support | which | requires | more | detailed | focus | than | estimating | average | reactions | Huylenbroeck | et | al | 2006 | Although | mathematical | programming | is | normative | in | nature | models | used | in | agriculture | can | be | identified | as | positive | as | empirical | information | on | farmers | behaviour | as | well | as | validation | against | actual | decisions | are | most | often | used | Relevant | literature | includes | the | evaluation | of | energy | crops | for | biofuell | supply | in | France | and | Italy | Sourie | and | Rozakis | 2001 | Kazakçi | et | al | 2007 | Bartoli | et | al | 2016 | perennial | crop | supply | in | Greece | and | the | impact | of | the | Common | Agricultural | Policy | CAP | 2003 | reform | Lychnaras | and | Rozakis | 2006 | as | well | as | a | growing | body | of | literature | focusing | on | miscanthus | and | short | rotation | coppice | Styles | et | al | 2008 | Sherrington | and | Moran | 2010 | Bauen | et | al | 2010 | Van | der | Hilst | et | al | 2010 | Mathiou | et | al | ,2012 | Mathiou | et | al | 2014 | Focusing | on | Greek | agriculture | a | variety | of | mathematical | programming | sector | models | has | been | used | in | order | to | assess | the | impacts | of | CAP | reform | focusing | on | arable | farming | accommodating | staple | crops | such | as | cotton | tobacco | and | wheat | partial | equilibrium | models | incorporating | downward | sloping | demand | Rozakis | et | al | 2008 | multi | criteria | methods | with | non | interactive | elicitation | of | the | utility | function | Manos | et | al | 2009 | Sintori | et | al | ,2010 | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017b | interval | linear | programming | to | deal | with | uncertainty | Rozakis | 2011 | and | risk | programming | along | with | increasing | cost | functions | by | means | of | Positive | Mathematical | Programming | Petsakos | and | Rozakis | 2015

A | bottom | up | staircase | model | based | on | individual | farm | data | is | specified | for | arable | agriculture | to | simulate | the | decision | making | process | at | farm | level | A | modular | structure | allows | for | taking | into | account | the | diversity | of | the | arable | farm | system | and | production | technology | to | a | large | extent | independent | of | time | series | data | thus | appropriate | for | policy | analysis | in | cases | of | substantial | policy | reforms | Rozakis | and | Sourie | 2001

Each | sub | model | consists | of | objective | function | and | a | number | of | resource- | institutional | and | agronomic | constraints | The | major | interest | of | this | modeling | certainly | lies | on | the | possibility | of | the | farms | sample | to | evolve | from | year | y | to | year | y+1 | In | order | to | modify | the | nature | of | Multi | Criteria | Linear | Programming | MCLP | model | from | static | to | sequential | at | the | end | of | each | annual | optimization | simple | rules | are | applied | to | simulate | the | evolution | of | the | number | of | farms | and | their | structure | for | the | period | 2015 | 2019 | 1 | Thus | the | disappearance | of | a | farm | is | due | to | relatively | low | level | of | farm | viability | index | On | the | contrary | farms | with | relatively | high | levels | of | farm | viability | index | incorporate | the | arable | land | of | less | efficient | farms

For | the | purpose | of | energy | crops | supply | curves | estimation | a | sequential | linear | programming | model | is | developed | which | takes | into | consideration | the | deployment | of | farms | decisions | in | time | illustrating | crop | mix | and | economic | indicators | in | the | medium | term | Guinde | et | al | 2005 | Gallan | Martin | et | al | 2015 | Robert | et | al | 2016 | Afterwards | we | introduce | in | the | decision | system | of | the | farmer | the | perennial | crops | option | and | we | assume | that | cost | and | yield | data | on | the | studied | energy | crops | correspond | to | annual | equivalent | values | because | of | the | perennial | life | cycles | of | these | thus | we | maximize | their | Net | Present | Value | NPV | of | gross | margins | Parametric | optimization | to | generate | supply | curves | can | be | implemented | using | any | objective | functional | form | in | linear | or | nonlinear | programming | models | Mathiou | et | al | 2014 | Parametric | optimization | consists | of | iterative | solutions | of | the | model | by | increasing | the | value | of | energy | crop | price | Mathiou | et | al | 2012 | Taking | into | consideration | the | price | range | for | biomass | of | pellet | industry | we | obtain | the | energy | crop | supply | curve | for | every | year | that | we | optimize | the | model | Consequently | the | sequential | Linear | Programming | model | could | provide | us | the | opportunity | to | forecast | energy | crops | supply | curves | in | a | more | realistic | way | 2

Static | MCLP | model | architecture | CAP | 2014 | 20 | Different | objective | functions | correspond | to | different | goals | of | farmers | The | first | goal | is | the | gross | margin | maximization | considering | that | a | business | oriented | farm | attempts | to | optimize | its | economic | performance | Despite | the | business | orientation | of | farms | family | labor | covers | almost | 30 | of | total | labor | requirements | Thus | we | assume | that | farmers | attempt | to | maximize | family | labor | through | their | crop | mix | decision | Minimization | of | risk | is | an | additional | criterion | found | in | the | literature | review | Amador | et | al | 1998 | Petsakos | et | al | 2009 | However | this | specific | criterion | is | not | studied | in | this | paper | because | we | assume | that | the | expectations | of | the | Greek | farms | about | unknown | values | of | parameters | e.g. | prices | of | non | contracted | crops | crop | yields | are | based | on | the | most | recent | experience | More | specifically | in | the | case | of | non | contracted | crops | e.g. | cotton | maize | alfalfa | durum | wheat | the | value | of | expected | price | is | considered | the | received | price | of | the | t-1 | period | Regarding | crop | yields | farmers | consider | that | they | do | n't | vary | significantly | from | year | to | year | thus | the | data | on | yields | for | some | preceding | years | could | be | used | to | calculate | an | average | representative | expected | yield | for | each | farm

All | crops | cultivated | are | treated | as | alternative | activities | for | every | farm | in | the | sample | For | crops | not | present | in | a | production | plan | the | average | data | of | sample | concerning | yield | and | family | labor | are | used | As | regards | the | crop | cost | forecasting | in | the | case | of | agricultural | inputs | e.g. | fertilizers | and | labor | cost | the | average | cost | of | the | sample | is | used | while | in | the | case | of | mechanical | operations | costs | the | degree | of | mechanization | of | the | farm | is | taken | into | consideration | in | order | to | estimate | the | possible | rental | rate | of | machinery | and | fuel | costs | with | precision | for | detailed | information | concerning | the | static | MCLP | see | also | Mantziaris | and | Rozakis | 2016

The | goals | and | constraints | used | in | this | analysis | and | their | mathematical | expressions | are | given | below | see | also | table | A1 | in | the | Appendix | for | the | indices | parameters | and | decision | variables

Crop | Diversification | obligation | for | farms | with | land | entitlements | area | 30 | hectares

Farmers | should | cultivate | at | least | three | different | crops | set | aside | included | and | the | sum | of | cropping | area | of | the | two | largest | crops | can | not | exceed | 95 | of | the | new | CAP | land | entitlements | area | in | order | to | receive | the | Greening | Payment | 30 | of | new | CAP | decoupled | payment | In | order | to | find | the | two | largest | crops | in | terms | of | land | coverage | for | farms | with | land | entitlements | greater | than | 30 | hectares | we | optimize | the | model | adding | the | three | above | constraints | equations | 7 | 8 | 9 | After | optimization | we | obtain | the | results | concerning | the | two | largest | crops | and | we | add | the | fourth | constraint | 10 | Then | we | optimize | the | model | once | more

It | should | be | noted | that | farmers | are | not | obligated | to | apply | the | greening | requirements | in | the | organic | cropping | area

The | set | aside | area | must | be | at | least | equal | to | 5 | of | land | entitlements | of | nitrogen | reduction | pollution | program | for | methodology | B.

Organic | farming | program

The | sum | of | eligible | crops | area | for | organic | farming | must | be | at | least | equal | to | land | entitlements | of | organic | farming | program

As | we | mentioned | above | the | disappearance | of | farms | is | due | to | relatively | low | levels | of | farm | viability | index | On | the | contrary | farms | with | relatively | high | viability | levels | incorporate | the | arable | land | of | less | efficient | farms

As | viability | index | of | farms | we | use | the | Return | to | Working | Capital | that | has | already | been | used | in | order | to | estimate | the | impacts | of | CAP | reform | 2003 | to | Greek | cotton | farmers | Rozakis | et | al | 2008 | The | formulation | of | the | index | is | as | follows

In | the | case | that | Return | to | Working | Capital | RWC | is | equal | or | lower | than | interest | rates | for | regular | bank | deposits | 5 | viability | threshold | farmers | would | not | keep | on | cultivating | After | each | annual | optimization | of | MCLP | model | the | total | land | of | non | viable | farms | of | year | t | is | incorporated | from | viable | farms | in | the | year | t+1 | and | redistributed | among | them | proportionally | according | to | RWC | efficiency | The | specific | rule | is | described | by | the | formula | below

The | working | capital | is | adjusted | from | year | to | year | according | to | the | formula | below

The | relation

represents | the | percentage | of | gross | revenue | that | is | intended | for | the | working | capital | needs | in | the | baseline | year | Thus | we | assume | that | the | percentage | remains | fixed | for | each | annual | optimization | after | the | baseline | year | 2015

The | land | rental | expenses | are | adjusted | annually | according | to | the | added | land | in | the | context | of | redistribution | described | above | We | assume | that | viable | farms | they | do | not | buy | the | added | land | but | they | prefer | to | rent | it | Currently | the | land | rental | rates | per | hectare | are | considered | fixed | and | correspond | to | 650 | and | 350 | euros | for | irrigated | and | non | irrigated | land | respectively | The | annual | rental | expenses | are | estimated | according | to | the | formula | below

In | our | analysis | we | take | into | consideration | the | crop | price | variance | For | the | purpose | of | price | forecasting | we | use | logarithmic | function | as | follows

In | order | to | estimate | the | logarithmic | function | for | each | studied | crop | we | use | a | combination | of | data | that | emanate | from | relevant | institutions | FADN | Hellenic | Ministry | of | Rural | Development | and | Food | The | time | series | data | cover | the | ten | year | 2006 | to | 2015 | timespan

At | this | point | it | should | be | noted | that | logarithmic | function | is | considered | suitable | for | our | analysis | since | the | increasing | trend | of | crop | prices | is | followed | by | stabilization | Additionally | we | validated | the | forecasting | ability | of | logarithmic | function | comparing | the | observed | prices | with | the | forecasted | prices | of | the | last | four | years | The | results | of | validation | reveal | limited | deviation | for | all | crops | that | is | range | from | 0,42 | to | 12,47 | see | also | tables | A2 | A6 | and | figures | A1 | A4 | in | the | Appendix | As | regards | the | prices | of | contracted | crops | tobacco | processed | tomato | processed | peppers | are | considered | fixed | at | baseline | year | levels

We | also | take | into | consideration | the | variable | cost | variance | For | the | purposes | of | variable | cost | forecasting | we | also | use | logarithmic | function

The | logarithmic | function | uses | as | input | variable | cost | indices | that | emanate | from | the | Hellenic | Statistical | Authority | 2018 | Regarding | the | crop | yields | they | are | considered | invariable | at | baseline | year | levels | since | the | observed | yields | of | the | study | area | especially | for | tobacco | processed | peppers | and | processed | tomato | are | considerably | higher | than | the | regional | or | national | averages | that | emanate | from | institutional | databases | FADN | Hellenic | Ministry | of | Rural | Development | Food

Additionally | according | to | the | sample | farmers | insignificant | yield | variations | are | observed | over | the | years | Consequently | we | assume | that | the | observed | yields | could | be | more | representative | for | the | simulation | of | the | specific | farming | system

Payments | adjustments | in | MCLP | sequential | model | concerning | CAP | 2014 | 20 | are | described | in | order | to | estimate | the | impacts | of | the | reform | at | the | last | year | of | subsidies | convergence | 2019

The | Greek | government | has | opted | for | the | partial | convergence | scheme | for | direct | payments | In | all | these | cases | the | convergence | process | is | linear | thus | farms | loose | or | gain | a | fixed | amount | each | year | Hellenic | Ministry | of | Rural | Development | Food | 2014 | In | our | analysis | we | estimated | the | decoupled | payments | for | each | year | of | the | period | 2015 | 19 | according | to | the | conditions | described | above

Coupled | payments | have | been | determined | a | priori | by | the | Hellenic | Ministry | of | Rural | Development | and | Food | 2014 | as | follows | Agri | environmental | payments | of | organic | farming | and | nitrogen | pollution | reduction | program | are | considered | fixed | at | baseline | year | levels

Surveyed | farms | are | located | in | the | plain | of | Regional | unit | of | Karditsa | one | of | the | most | important | arable | farming | regions | in | Greece | to | 48 | farms | out | of | 70 | initially | surveyed | in | 2005 | 06 | specializing | in | arable | farming | It | has | to | be | noted | that | between | 2005/2006 | and | 2012 | one | third | of | the | initially | surveyed | 70 | farms | have | gone | out | of | business | as | most | of | them | retired | and | a | few | passed | away | without | succession | their | land | has | passed | to | the | remaining | 48 | farms | which | have | thus | been | enlarged | average | farm | area | increased | from | about | 12 | ha | to | 17.6 | ha | see | also | table | A9 | in | the | Appendix | As | we | see | at | table | 5 | compared | with | the | average | farm | of | the | whole | country | sample | farms | are | much | larger | in | both | physical | and | economic | size | more | intense | as | regards | their | irrigated | land | and | more | entrepreneurial | in | terms | of | use | of | hired | labour | in | their | total | human | employment | needs | Mantziaris | et | al | ,2017c | Thus | we | assume | that | the | specific | farmers | would | be | willing | to | cultivate | innovative | crops | as | perennial | energy | crops | On | the | other | hand | sample | farms | are | much | less | labour | intensive | since | they | use | human | labour | for | 433 | hours | per | year | compared | with | 1152 | hours | of | the | respective | national | average | Also | 60 | of | gross | revenue | of | sample | farms | is | derived | from | the | market | while | the | remaining | 40 | comes | from | subsidies | 25 | from | decoupled | payments | 11 | from | coupled | payments | and | 4 | from | agri | environmental | payments | this | means | that | sample | farms | are | more | dependent | on | subsidies | as | for | 2012 | on | average | Greek | farms | derived | 73 | of | their | gross | revenue | from | the | market | and | 27 | from | subsidies | Eurostat | 2017

Although | the | most | important | crop | for | the | period | 2005 | 2012 | in | terms | of | land | coverage | is | cotton | significant | changes | in | the | crop | mix | of | sample | farms | have | been | recorded | between | 2005 | and | 2012 | figure | 1 | Up | until | 2005 | tobacco | Virginia | variety | held | the | lion | 's | share | in | terms | of | revenue | stream | cultivated | at | a | significant | percentage | of | total | land | 20 | In | 2006 | with | full | decoupling | of | subsidies | tobacco | cultivation | was | abandoned | as | the | variable | cost | exceeded | the | farm | gate | market | price | of | tobacco | almost | 1 | euros | kg | and | 0.3 | euros | kg | respectively | However | in | 2012 | tobacco | cultivation | covered | 6.7 | of | the | total | land | fig | 1 | because | of | farm | gate | price | that | had | increased | since | 2010 | up | to | 2 | euros | kg | 6

Another | major | evolution | during | the | period | 2005 | 2012 | is | the | considerable | increase | of | alfalfa | cultivation | due | to | the | partial | and | full | decoupling | of | subsidies | for | cotton | and | maize | respectively | which | resulted | in | a | reduction | of | revenue | for | these | two | crops | Consequently | alfalfa | cultivation | became | more | competitive | since | it | is | characterized | by | similar | variable | costs | compared | to | cotton | and | maize

Τhe | increase | of | set | aside | is | mainly | due | to | the | fact | that | a | significant | number | of | farmers | participate | in | the | nitrogen | reduction | agri | environmental | program | in | the | context | of | Second | Pillar | of | CAP | for | the | 2007 | 13 | programming | period | whereby | they | are | obligated | to | set | aside | a | part | of | irrigated | arable | land | Figure | 2 | illustrates | the | average | cultivated | area | per | crop | indicating | a | noteworthy | enlargement | of | scale | and | most | probably | the | attainment | of | economies | of | scale | for | crops | like | processed | tomato | cotton | alfalfa | tobacco | and | processed | pepper | Additionally | more | than | 90 | of | farms | own | the | machinery | for | all | operations | except | for | harvesting | The | rate | of | harvesting | equipment | ownership | varies | widely | from | 22 | in | cotton | to | 45 | in | alfalfa | and | 100 | in | processed | tomato | Also | 60 | of | total | land | is | rented | Moreover | 31 | of | the | sample | farms | participate | in | optional | agrienvironmental | measures | of | the | Second | Pillar | More | specifically | 23 | of | farms | participate | in | nitrogen | pollution | reduction | program | Variant | B | 4 | in | nitrogen | reduction | program | Variant | A | and | 4 | in | organic | farming | The | size | of | land | that | is | intended | for | the | application | of | agrienvironmental | measures | corresponds | to | 30 | of | total | land

In | the | table | 6 | are | presented | some | basic | techno | economic | data | of | studied | crops | For | additional | information | concerning | the | cost | and | yield | estimation | of | energy | crops | see | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017a

After | optimizing | the | sequential | model | described | above | the | overall | crop | mix | for | each | studied | year | is | revealed | Generally | the | crop | mix | is | characterized | by | a | stabilization | trend | A | weak | increasing | trend | is | observed | for | the | set | aside | since | 2017 | that | is | correlated | with | a | weak | decreasing | trend | for | the | majority | of | crops | see | also | table | 7 | and | figure | 3 | The | number | of | farms | decreases | by | 11 | i.e. | 2.2 | by | year | and | 28.7 | hectares | 71 | correspond | to | irrigated | land | redistributed | to | the | rest | of | farms | It | may | be | expected | that | a | larger | number | of | farms | is | going | to | be | disappeared | due | to | the | austerity | measures | in | the | context | of | Third | Memorandum | Measures | that | stand | since | 2015 | for | the | Greek | economy | and | affect | directly | the | agricultural | sector | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017b | Concerning | the | basic | economic | results | and | parameters | gross | revenue | is | decreased | by | 14 | gross | margin | by | 16 | and | working | capital | by | 12 | The | specific | results | may | be | affected | by | the | significant | reduction | of | decoupled | payments | by | 28 | The | 90 | of | farms | are | going | to | lose | significant | part | of | their | decoupled | subsidies | due | to | their | high | levels | of | entitlements | value | 948 | ha | compared | to | the | baseline | entitlement | value | of | 420 | ha | that | stands | for | the | agronomic | region | of | arable | farming | After | introducing | in | the | decision | system | of | farms | the | perennial | energy | crops | option | we | apply | a | realistic | price | range | for | biomass | of | pellet | industry | Unfortunately | price | data | on | the | studied | crops | were | not | available | due | to | the | lack | of | an | established | market | for | these | crops | in | Greece | Instead | we | use | current | contract | prices | for | cardoon | biomass | in | the | areas | of | Karditsa | and | Central | Macedonia | which | correspond | to | 50 | /dry | tone | dtn | and | 73 | /dry | tone | dtn | at | farm | gate | level | respectively | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017a | Kathimerini | 2011 | Thus | the | price | range | was | determined | from | 50 | /dtn | to | 80 | /dtn

Taking | into | consideration | the | specific | price | range | we | optimize | the | multi | annual | model | and | obtain | the | crop | mix | for | every | year | of | the | period | 2015 | 19 | In | the | following | graphs | is | presented | the | multi | annual | crop | mix | for | each | biomass | price | of | studied | range | As | biomass | price | increases | Arundo | cultivation | reveals | significant | possibility | of | expansion | compared | to | miscanthus | and | poplar | According | to | the | multi | annual | optimal | crop | mix | arundo | is | characterized | as | the | most | profitable | cultivation | among | studied | energy | crops | within | the | applied | price | range | On | the | other | hand | durum | wheat | and | set | aside | are | decreased | significantly | Then | we | modified | the | energy | crop | cultivations | from | hectares | to | dry | biomass | tones | in | order | to | estimate | the | multi | annual | biomass | supply | curve | at | energy | crop | level | but | also | at | aggregate | level | More | specifically | each | energy | crop | hectare | was | multiplied | with | the | biomass | yield | per | hectare | Afterwards | annual | optimal | produced | quantities | of | biomass | for | the | studied | price | range | were | used | in | order | to | estimate | the | energy | crops | supply | curves | Generally | arundo | biomass | supply | is | detected | in | considerably | higher | levels | for | the | same | price | compared | to | the | other | energy | crops | for | each | studied | year | Thus | arundo | is | considered | the | most | profitable | option | among | energy | crops | for | the | majority | of | sample | farms | As | we | mentioned | above | the | initial | target | of | the | existing | pellet | manufacturer | in | the | area | is | to | produce | 1100 | tons | of | pellets | from | biomass | with | the | plant | operating | in | a | single | shift | ESEK | 2016 | where | 450 | tons | correspond | to | cardoon | dry | biomass | and | the | rest | 650 | tons | could | be | covered | by | the | combination | of | arundo | miscanthus | and | poplar | dry | biomass | Where | 450 | tons | correspond | to | cardoon | dry | biomass | and | the | rest | 650 | tons | could | be | covered | by | the | combination | of | arundo | miscanthus | and | poplar | dry | biomass

1 | ha | Cardoon | 4.5 | dry | tons

1 | ha | Arundo | 8.49 | dry | tons

1 | ha | Miscanthus | 7.07 | dry | tons

1 | ha | Poplar | 7.07 | dry | tons | 7 | It | may | be | expected | that | a | larger | amount | of | dry | matter | is | required | because | of | the | relatively | low | net | calorific | value | of | cardoon | and | the | loss | of | dry | matter | during | pellet | production | process | The | above | analysis | informs | decision | making | at | various | levels | For | example | pellet | producers | can | use | our | results | to | design | incentives | to | biomass | producers | through | efficient | pricing | of | biomass | from | each | energy | crop | Procuring | biomass | from | farms | seems | even | more | sensible | since | the | existing | 12 | pellet | producing | factories | in | Greece | currently | utilize | only | 25 | of | their | maximum | total | capacity | of | 130 | thousand | tons | year | using | biomass | from | non | energy | crops | Toka | 2015 | Thus | it | might | be | an | efficient | strategy | for | these | factories | to | increase | their | production | volume | by | using | biomass | from | high | calorific | value | crops | such | as | Arundo | Miscanthus | and | Poplar

Policy | design | is | also | informed | by | our | results | Considering | the | overall | positive | impacts | at | the | regional | and | national | levels | policy | makers | might | want | to | design | adequate | policies | that | would | provide | efficient | and | compatible | incentives | to | farmers | and | energy | producing | plants

However | a | decision | making | prerequisite | for | the | farmer | would | be | the | development | of | a | stable | market | for | biomass | This | would | mean | that | significant | investment | is | undertaken | e.g. | in | biomass | power | plants | and | the | mechanisms | that | build | trust | between | the | various | actors | of | the | biomass | supply | chain | are | in | place | e.g. | the | availability | of | long | term | contracting | Once | the | market | develops | however | there | should | be | many | more | issues | that | deserve | careful | consideration | before | a | farmer | engages | in | the | production | of | these | crops | Contract | designs | and | the | way | farmers | are | organized | communal | and | individual | senses | of | landscape | the | fluctuations | of | the | oil | market | as | well | as | environmental | considerations | are | to | mention | a | few | some | of | the | issues | that | may | influence | farmers | but | also | investors | decision | making | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017a

The | energy | debate | in | Greece | as | in | other | European | countries | has | resulted | into | a | number | of | different | and | often | conflicting | narratives | The | European | Commission | considers | biomass | as | a | critical | element | of | the | fight | against | climate | change | and | recognizes | the | prospects | that | energy | crops | can | have | for | farmers | and | local | communities | as | well | as | for | national | renewable | energy | plans | IEA | 2011 | On | the | other | hand | there | are | several | concerns | raised | within | Greece | on | the | potential | effects | of | energy | crops | and | biomass | power | plants | on | land | use | and | the | environment | Savvanidou | et | al | 2010

Within | this | context | policy | makers | should | undertake | actions | that | provide | incentives | for | the | adoption | of | energy | crops | while | at | the | same | time | counter | balance | possible | environmental | and | economic | risks | and | deal | with | the | concerns | of | local | communities | The | appropriate | policy | mix | and | the | subsequent | implementation | of | a | successful | renewable | energy | strategy | is | a | rather | difficult | puzzle | for | national | and | regional | decision | makers | This | complexity | partially | explains | the | variety | of | national | approaches | as | well | as | market | shares | of | renewable | energy | across | the | EU

In | Greece | market | deployment | policies | have | been | prioritized | feed | in | tariffs | quotas | and | establishment | incentives | for | the | biofuels | industry | have | been | implemented | mainly | in | order | to | support | the | development | of | the | industry | Incentives | to | farmers | are | provided | mainly | by | the | industrial | actors | through | the | application | of | contract | farming | schemes | that | reduce | the | risk | for | farmers | and | provide | income | stability | in | the | longer | run | Meeting | the | targets | set | by | the | RES | roadmap | until | 2020 | 18 | share | of | renewable | energy | in | the | gross | final | energy | consumptionimplies | that | in | Greece | there | still | exists | a | considerable | scope | for | the | development | of | the | biofuels | supply | chain | 8

When | focusing | on | the | Greek | pellet | market | an | increased | demand | for | pellets | is | forecasted | mainly | due | to | the | considerably | high | cost | of | heating | diesel | which | has | become | a | major | issue | for | most | Greek | households | during | the | years | of | economic | crisis | Furthermore | starting | at | 2011 | the | use | of | biomass | heating | boilers | in | apartment | buildings | has | been | allowed | in | the | two | largest | Greek | cities | Athens | and | Thessaloniki | The | increase | in | the | household | demand | will | probably | trigger | the | demand | for | biomass | feed | stocks | As | a | result | the | motivations | provided | to | the | Greek | bioenergy | industry | should | be | coupled | by | incentives | for | farmers | to | cultivate | energy | crops | and | thus | reduce | the | risks | of | even | larger | national | trade | deficits | from | biomass | imports

A | case | study | has | been | presented | in | this | paper | to | demonstrate | the | potential | of | some | energy | crops | to | replace | under | certain | circumstances | conventional | crops | even | in | non | marginal | lands | However | there | are | more | aspects | that | should | be | considered | by | policy | makers | before | deciding | on | the | final | mix | of | appropriate | bioenergy | policies | A | wider | look | should | take | into | account | not | only | economic | but | also | social | cultural | political | and | environmental | perspectives | along | the | whole | spectrum | of | the | bioenergy | supply | chain | This | argument | can | be | exemplified | by | the | Swedish | case | study | as | stated | by | Ostwald | et | al | 2013 | The | authors | argue | that | although | economic | motivations | for | changing | production | systems | are | strong | factors | such | as | values | e.g. | aesthetic | environmental | knowledge | e.g. | habits | and | knowledge | of | production | methods | and | legal | conditions | e.g. | cultivation | licenses | are | crucial | for | the | change | to | energy | crops | Also | as | suggested | by | Paulrud | and | Laitila | 2010 | issues | related | to | the | visual | impact | on | the | landscape | and | the | rotation | period | of | the | energy | crop | appear | to | have | a | significant | impact | on | the | utility | derived | from | growing | an | energy | crop

Moreover | the | economic | recession | enhances | risk | aversion | diminishes | the | availability | of | investment | capital | and | may | disable | incentive | mechanisms | that | have | been | introduced | in | former | years | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017a | It | may | be | expected | that | a | larger | number | of | farms | will | go | out | of | business | due | to | the | austerity | measures | in | the | context | of | Third | Memorandum | Measures | that | stand | since | 2015 | for | the | Greek | economy | and | affect | directly | the | agricultural | sector | Apart | from | the | above | mentioned | changes | in | the | CAP | the | policy | environment | in | which | Greek | agriculture | operates | is | also | determined | by | an | extremely | strict | set | of | policy | measures | These | measures | are | part | of | the | adjustment | programs | of | the | Greek | economy | since | 2010 | including | increases | of | taxation | rates | on | household | income | business | profits | and | heating | oil | increase | of | social | insurance | contributions | and | VAT | Value | Added | Tax | for | specified | products | and | services | e.g. | food | products | and | drinks | alcohol | drinks | cigarettes | diesel | oil | restaurants | tourism | etc | as | well | as | cuts | of | pensions | public | sector | salaries | and | handouts | Within | this | context | a | series | of | measures | have | been | in | place | since | 2015 | concerning | the | agricultural | sector | such | as | the | abolishment | of | tax | allowance | of | diesel | oil | used | by | farmers | doubling | of | the | taxation | on | farm | income | which | reached | 26 | in | 2017 | payment | of | this | tax | on | an | anticipatory | basis | and | a | significant | increase | in | social | welfare | contributions | Mantziaris | et | al | 2017c

As | a | proposal | for | future | research | it | would | be | wise | to | investigate | through | a | wider | and | multidisciplinary | study | the | factors | involved | in | the | decision | making | process | at | all | levels | of | the | bioenergy | supply | chain

To | conclude | our | results | show | the | potential | of | local | bioenergy | supply | chains | that | use | locally | grown | perennial | energy | crops | as | their | main | input | to | provide | a | source | of | income | to | farmers | Yet | policy | makers | need | to | adopt | a | more | systemic | approach | to | designing | and | implementing | energy | policies | Other | economic | environmental | and | cultural | concerns | need | to | be | addressed | simultaneously | Depicting | and | studying | all | significant | parts | of | the | involved | systems | and | subsystems | as | well | as | their | interactions | associations | and | resulting | impacts | can | achieve | this | Subsequently | policy | makers | need | to | facilitate | changes | that | will | help | and | enable | the | whole | energy | system | to | self | organize | into | a | new | desired | state

Aggregate | supply | curve | could | be | used | in | order | to | estimate | the | contract | price | under | the | multiannual | context | Thus | pellet | manufacturer | could | design | the | medium | term | or | long | term | price | strategy | in | order | to | ensure | the | required | raw | material | quantities | The | estimated | required | contract | price | for | biomass | per | dtn | ranges | from | 64 | euros | to | 67.6 | euros | see | also | table | 10 | Aggregate | biomass | supply | moves | upwards | over | the | studied | years | see | also | figure | 7 | These | results | illustrate | that | payments | convergence | may | has | a | negative | effect | on | biomass | production | potentials | As | regards | the | evolution | of | farm | viability | and | economic | results | remain | almost | at | the | same | levels | as | before | the | introduction | of | energy | crops | in | decision | system | More | specifically | 11 | of | farms | disappear | 29.1 | hectares | are | redistributed | and | the | gross | margin | is | increased | by | 1 | in | average | terms | compared | to | conventional | farming | system | see | also | table | A10 | in | the | Appendix

Concerning | the | crop | mix | durum | wheat | and | set | aside | are | decreased | significantly | due | to | the | introduction | of | perennial | energy | crops | in | the | conventional | farming | system | see | also | figure | 8 | and | table | A11 | in | the | Appendix
