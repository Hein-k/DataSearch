Livestock | production | in | developed | countries | has | undergone | profound | changes | in | recent | decades | and | this | development | seems | to | continue | apace | One | consequence | is | that | manure | is | being | -and | will | be | -produced | on | fewer | but | larger | farms | Data | on | the | bulk | of | manure | nutrients | from | each | country | are | published | by | Eurostat | but | it | is | not | known | how | manure | is | distributed | across | farms | of | different | sizes | This | study | 1 | puts | forward | an | estimate | of | the | distribution | of | main | manure | nutrients | between | farms | of | different | sizes | 2 | estimates | how | this | distribution | will | change | in | the | near | future | and | 3 | discusses | the | land | use | effects | of | this | development | Results | suggest | that | by | the | year | 2030 | farms | housing | 500 | livestock | units | will | produce | more | than | two | thirds | of | all | manure | phosphorus | whereas | the | proportion | in | 2010 | was | one | third | With | the | Nitrates | Directive | limiting | the | use | of | organic | nitrate | of | manure | growing | farms | need | to | acquire | or | conclude | contracts | for | the | use | of | 4.9 | million | hectares | from | exiting | farms | or | the | open | market | in | order | to | comply | with | manure | spreading | requirements | This | shift | will | involve | 64 | of | the | total | spreading | area | of | 2010 | and | 15 | of | the | total | utilized | agricultural | area | of | the | regions | studied | In | light | of | these | predictions | international | nutrient | policies | should | consider | the | evolution | of | farm | structure | in | general | and | manure | phosphorus | agglomeration | in | particular | Also | salient | is | improved | co | operation | beyond | the | single | farm | level | to | ensure | the | functionality | of | crop | livestock | systems

Agricultural | production | has | become | increasingly | specialized | The | productivity | of | the | agricultural | sector | has | increased | at | the | same | time | as | less | intensive | mixed | farming | systems | that | integrate | crop | and | livestock | production | decline | in | many | countries | or | regions | Peyraud | et | al | 2014 | In | the | case | of | livestock | production | specialization | often | means | a | transition | to | larger | production | units | It | also | increases | the | segregation | of | livestock | and | crop | production | areas | Gaigné | et | al | 2011 | On | the | one | hand | specialization | may | strengthen | the | competitiveness | of | livestock | production | and | promote | innovations | on | the | other | it | may | hasten | a | transition | toward | monoculture | and | impede | the | supply | of | organic | matter | in | the | form | of | manure | to | crop | production | regions | Structural | change | may | also | alter | the | pressure | that | manure | nutrients | place | on | nutrient | runoff | and | water | quality | by | increasing | the | agglomeration | of | animals

Livestock | production | contributes | to | spatial | accumulation | of | nutrients | Confined | animal | facilities | use | imported | feed | to | supplement | feedstuff | grown | on | the | farm | 's | own | fields | The | total | amount | of | nutrients | in | manure | generated | by | the | production | animals | may | exceed | the | agronomic | needs | of | the | crops | grown | within | an | economically | sensible | distance | of | the | animal | facility | Indeed | more | nutrients | tend | to | be | imported | into | intensive | animal | production | areas | in | the | form | of | animal | feed | than | are | exported | from | them | in | the | form | of | end | products | This | results | in | nutrient | surpluses | which | increase | the | risk | of | nutrient | loading | to | surface | and | ground | waters | Koelsch | 2005 | Innes | 2000 | Baerenklau | et | al | 2008 | The | higher | the | number | of | production | animals | in | a | facility | the | greater | the | likelihood | of | nutrients | accumulating | locally

The | nutrient | concentration | in | manure | and | the | agronomic | needs | for | nutrients | vary | for | different | production | animals | and | crops | If | phosphorus | is | not | the | focus | of | a | farm | 's | manure | use | plan | and | the | application | of | manure | nitrogen | matches | nitrogen | uptake | cropland | may | receive | an | excess | of | phosphorus | as | manure | typically | contains | more | phosphorus | than | crops | require | Where | phosphorus | accumulates | in | soil | the | concentration | of | dissolved | reactive | phosphorus | in | runoff | gradually | increases | which | in | turn | accelerates | eutrophication | of | surface | waters | Pote | et | al | 1996 | Uusitalo | et | al | 2016

The | Baltic | Sea | suffers | from | eutrophication | caused | by | excessive | nutrient | loading | Most | anthropogenic | nutrient | flows | are | linked | to | the | food | chain | We | have | been | able | to | curtail | the | point | wise | leaks | in | this | chain | relatively | efficiently | but | controlling | the | non | point | loading | from | https://doi.org/10.1016/j.agsy.2019.102771 | Received | 18 | July | 2018 | Received | in | revised | form | 13 | December | 2019 | Accepted | 13 | December | 2019 | Corresponding | author | E | mail | addresses | olli.niskanen@luke.fi | O. | Niskanen | antti.iho@luke.fi | A. | Iho | leena.kalliovirta@helsinki.fi | L. | Kalliovirta

T | agriculture | has | proven | more | difficult | Large | volumes | of | manure | are | being | generated | and | handled | in | agricultural | production | Countries | with | a | significant | proportion | or | all | of | their | land | acreage | in | the | Baltic | Sea | drainage | basin | Denmark | Estonia | Finland | Latvia | Lithuania | Poland | Germany | and | Sweden | apply | manure | in | some | form | as | fertilizer | amounting | to | a | total | of | 1370 | thousand | tons | of | nitrogen | and | 280 | thousand | tons | of | phosphorus | Eurostat | 2017 | Manure | nutrients | account | for | 34 | of | all | nitrogen | inputs | and | 51 | of | all | phosphorus | inputs | used | in | agriculture | Given | that | the | total | annual | phosphorus | loading | to | the | Baltic | is | currently | around | 30 | thousand | tons | HELCOM | 2019 | any | changes | in | animal | agriculture | that | affect | the | handling | storage | and | application | of | manure | are | likely | to | have | impacts | on | nutrient | loading | to | the | Baltic | Sea

The | spatial | accumulation | of | nutrients | in | intensive | livestock | regions | has | its | roots | in | the | high | transportation | costs | of | manure | for | the | value | of | manure | as | a | source | of | plant | nutrients | declines | as | the | hauling | distances | increase | The | bottom | line | economically | is | that | it | is | rational | to | apply | manure | approximately | up | to | a | distance | where | its | marginal | costs | comprising | transportation | and | application | equal | those | of | chemical | fertilizers | Innes | 2000 | Schnitkey | and | Miranda | 1993

Transportation | costs | largely | explain | why | a | farming | system | having | one | thousand | facilities | with | 50 | animals | generates | a | different | manure | accumulation | pattern | than | one | having | 50 | facilities | with | one | thousand | animals | Both | continuous | and | discrete | crop | response | models | suggest | that | ceteris | paribus | the | more | animals | there | are | in | a | production | unit | the | higher | the | rates | at | which | manure | will | be | applied | in | the | manure | application | area | e.g. | Innes | 2000 | Schnitkey | and | Miranda | 1993 | Iho | et | al | 2016 | 1 |  | As | the | trends | described | above | suggest | the | change | in | livestock | production | toward | larger | farms | stands | to | increase | the | risk | of | local | nutrient | surpluses | Then | again | large | farms | may | have | better | opportunities | than | small | ones | to | respond | to | the | high | transaction | costs | of | environmental | regulation | for | example | by | adopting | new | technologies | see | e.g. | Falconer | 2000 | In | short | while | structural | change | creates | risks | of | spatial | nutrient | accumulation | and | elevated | runoff | it | also | offers | opportunities | to | address | these | threats | if | the | utilization | of | manure | nutrients | is | regulated | properly | and | coherently | across | national | borders

Without | regulation | there | is | a | risk | that | manure | will | be | applied | excessively | to | fields | near | production | facilities | increasing | the | risk | of | nutrient | loading | Kaplan | et | al | 2004 | Smith | et | al | 2001a | Smith | et | al | 2001b | Encouragingly | there | is | a | range | of | technical | options | to | mitigate | the | accumulation | of | manure | For | example | recycling | of | nutrients | from | segregated | crop | and | livestock | production | systems | can | be | enhanced | through | measures | such | as | processing | manure | creating | match | making | markets | between | manure | suppliers | and | crop | farmers | and | standardizing | the | nutrient | content | of | recycled | manure | Nesme | et | al | 2015

The | current | size | distribution | of | livestock | farms | in | the | Baltic | Sea | basin | has | arisen | in | different | economic | and | societal | contexts | Prior | to | 1989 | farms | in | the | Western | Bloc | developed | under | market | oriented | systems | and | the | common | agricultural | policy | CAP | which | differed | from | the | planned | economies | of | the | Eastern | Bloc | Buchenrieder | et | al | 2009 | Individual | and | rather | small | scale | farming | have | traditionally | been | the | norm | in | Poland | whereas | in | the | other | Baltic | countries | including | Russia | many | small | farms | were | combined | into | large | collective | farms | -kolkhozes | or | sovkhozes | -at | some | point | during | the | Soviet | era | ibid | The | legacy | of | different | historical | pathways | can | still | be | seen | in | the | stark | differences | in | farm | size | distribution | between | countries | although | today | agriculture | along | the | Baltic | coast | operates | under | relatively | similar | market | conditions

This | research | aims | to | 1 | give | an | estimate | of | the | distribution | between | different | sized | farms | of | the | main | manure | nutrients | 2 | estimate | how | this | distribution | will | change | in | the | near | future | and | 3 | discuss | the | land | use | effects | of | this | development | Our | estimate | of | how | the | size | of | livestock | farms | will | develop | in | the | course | of | the | next | decade | until | 2030 | has | been | derived | using | a | Markov | chain | model | which | applies | a | stochastic | approach | assessing | the | probability | that | a | farm | will | move | among | a | set | of | discrete | size | classes | Zimmermann | et | al | 2012 | The | Markov | results | are | combined | with | other | data | sources | in | order | to | visualize | how | the | projected | development | will | affect | the | allocation | of | manure | nutrients | between | farms | The | anticipated | land | use | effects | are | discussed | in | conjunction | with | the | relation | between | farm | size | and | stocking | rate

The | rest | of | the | paper | is | organized | as | follows | In | the | section | to | follow | we | introduce | materials | and | methods | The | third | section | presents | the | results | followed | by | the | fourth | section | of | discussion | and | concluding | fifth | section | with | a | discussion | of | the | implications | of | the | research

We | use | data | from | the | Farm | Structure | Survey | FSS | which | encompassed | Denmark | Estonia | Finland | Germany | Latvia | Lithuania | Poland | and | Sweden | The | data | include | all | livestock | farms | and | cover | the | years | 2003 | 2005 | 2007 | 2010 | and | 2013 | As | most | of | Germany | does | not | belong | to | the | catchment | area | of | the | Baltic | Sea | it | was | decided | that | only | three | NUTS | 1 | regions | -the | states | Brandenburg | DE4 | Mecklenburg | Western | Pomerania | DE8 | and | Schleswig | Holstein | DEF | -would | be | included | in | the | analysis | The | animal | numbers | are | measured | in | livestock | units | LSU | applying | the | conversion | coefficients | used | by | Eurostat | 2 |  | The | years | between | FSS | 's | have | been | retrieved | from | national | statistics | if | available | 3 | Years | that | we | were | unable | to | confirm | or | were | not | found | nationally | have | been | interpolated | from | FSS | data | by | matching | a | thirddegree | equation | over | the | observed | data | points | The | analysis | focuses | on | three | major | animal | groups | -bovines | pigs | and | poultry | -divided | into | four | categories | according | to | the | size | of | the | herd | Table | 1 | The | category | Other | livestock | includes | all | other | species | noted | by | Eurostat | The | thresholds | for | the | categories | are | those | used | in | the | original | survey | data

An | examination | of | the | above | data | reveals | a | number | of | similarities | in | development | across | countries | The | number | of | farms | has | decreased | drastically | in | all | countries | a | development | driven | mainly | by | the | trend | in | Poland | Fig | 1

There | are | some | apparent | inconsistencies | in | the | FSS | data | when | used | for | analysing | different | production | lines | For | some | countries | the | sum | of | bovine | pig | and | poultry | farms | is | higher | than | the | total | number | of | livestock | farms | in | the | same | statistic | as | farms | with | several | animal | species | have | been | counted | in | the | statistics | for | each | animal | Thus | our | estimates | draw | on | aggregated | data | that | are | based | on | total | livestock | and | therefore | count | livestock | farms | only | once | To | derive | projections | on | manure | nutrient | quantities | we | decompose | the | LSUs | into | animal | and | manure | types | The | procedure | is | explained | in | detail | in | the | following | section

Structural | change | has | been | recognized | as | an | important | factor | to | include | in | ex | ante | modelling | of | agricultural | policy | Zimmermann | et | al | 2009 | One | successful | approach | for | modelling | structural | change | is | to | estimate | transition | probabilities | from | one | size | class | to | another | using | Markov | chain | analysis | The | probabilities | can | be | further | used | to | project | development | in | the | coming | years | Transition | probabilities | are | assumed | to | be | stationary | or | non | stationary | depending | on | whether | they | change | over | time | Many | recent | Markov | chain | studies | rely | on | macrodata | with | prior | information | used | to | improve | estimation | efficiency | e.g. | Zepeda | 1995 | Karantininis | 2002 | Stokes | 2006 | Tonini | and | Jongeneel | 2009 | Huettel | and | Jongeneel | 2011 | Ben | Arfa | et | al | 2015 | Zimmermann | and | Heckelei | 2012 | combined | FADN | microdata | and | FSS | macrodata | in | estimating | the | probability | of | dairy | farm | transition | In | their | work | microdata | provided | prior | information | on | changes | in | farm | size | which | they | applied | in | estimating | the | macrodata

The | general | notation | of | the | Markov | model | presented | here | follows | Zimmermann | et | al | 2009 | The | movement | of | farms | between | farm | size | groups | follows | a | first | order | Markov | chain | i.e. | it | is | assumed | that | the | probability | of | the | movement | of | a | farm | at | time | t | to | another | farm | type | in | the | period | t | 1 | is | independent | of | earlier | periods | The | notation | can | be | written | as

where | the | number | of | farms | n | in | farm | type | j | at | time | t | depends | on | the | number | of | farms | in | all | farm | types | i | in | the | period | before | t | 1 | multiplied | by | their | respective | transition | probabilities | p | ij | to | move | from | farm | type | i | to | farm | type | j | in | one | time | period | The | total | number | of | farm | types | is | N. | The | probability | constraints | non | negativity | p | ij | 0 | and | summingup | to | unity | 2

The | transition | probabilities | can | be | used | to | predict | future | farm | numbers | in | any | state

3 | where | the | row | vector | X | 0 | is | the | initial | starting | state | vector | or | the | initial | configuration | of | individuals | in | the | N | states | x | 0i | represents | the | number | of | individuals | in | state | i | during | time | period | t | 0,and | the | row | vector | X | t | is | the | tth | configuration | vector

The | estimation | of | the | transition | probabilities | was | produced | using | the | SAS | 9.3 | PROC | ENTROPY | generalized | maximum | entropy | GME | method | SAS | Institute | 2014 | Detailed | description | is | presented | in | Appendix | 1 | The | method | allows | the | researcher | to | include | a | priori | information | that | is | support | points | In | principle | this | is | a | subjective | element | which | is | selected | by | authors | but | nevertheless | widely | used | in | the | literature | to | improve | estimation | efficiency | e.g. | Karantininis | 2002

Table | 2 | shows | the | prior | information | we | have | applied | in | the | estimation | Put | briefly | our | logic | has | been | to | set | upper | bounds | on | the | probabilities | for | each | of | the | transitions | that | are | possible | within | the | model | We | rule | out | movement | from | larger | to | smaller | farms | and | the

Livestock | units | by | animal | group | and | size | class | in | eight | countries | in | 2010 | Eurostat | 2016 |  | The | rationale | behind | the | prior | information | chosen | is | the | following | When | we | consider | the | frequency | of | changes | in | farm | size | in | one | year | the | most | probable | situation | is | that | a | farm | will | remain | in | the | same | size | class | as | in | the | previous | year | Where | an | increase | in | size | occurs | moving | up | one | size | class | in | a | single | year | is | more | probable | than | moving | up | two | or | three | Ben | Arfa | et | al | 2014 | The | data | does | not | contain | evidence | for | transitions | to | smaller | size | classes | and | therefore | such | transitions | were | dropped | from | the | estimation

Moving | to | and | returning | from | an | inactive | state | exit | entry | is | allowed | in | the | model | Inactivity | means | that | the | farm | is | not | engaged | in | livestock | production | However | because | of | the | long | term | commitment | required | by | the | business | the | probability | of | entry | is | often | considered | to | be | zero | or | close | to | zero | and | thus | no | positive | support | points | were | set | for | entry | Small | farms | are | more | likely | to | exit | than | large | farms | and | the | smaller | the | farm | the | higher | the | probability | of | its | exit | Foltz | 2004 | Tonini | and | Jongeneel | 2009

The | model | was | estimated | separately | for | each | country | with | the | resulting | transition | probabilities | used | to | generate | projections | of | farm | numbers | in | each | country | and | class | for | the | coming | years

After | farm | numbers | in | each | size | class | were | predicted | by | the | Markov | model | we | multiplied | the | number | of | farms | in | each | size | class | by | the | average | number | of | animals | in | the | corresponding | class | as | reported | in | the | FSS | The | observed | data | showed | minor | growth | in | the | average | number | of | animals | in | the | three | smallest | size | categories | In | the | projection | we | took | this | into | account | by | estimating | a | linear | trend | describing | the | behaviour | of | the | observed | data | which | indicated | that | the | average | number | of | animals | in | each | size | class | increases | slightly | each | year | The | change | within | a | particular | class | is | limited | however | given | that | when | farms | with | 50 | LSUs | start | to | grow | they | quickly | move | up | into | the | next | size | class | 50 | LSU | 100 | Similarly | in | the | 50 | LSU | 100 | LSU | and | 100 | LSU | 500 | classes | when | a | farm | increases | in | size | it | moves | into | a | higher | class | Taking | minor | growth | within | a | class | into | account | with | the | trend | is | important | in | the | case | of | Poland | for | example | where | the | number | of | farms | in | the | smallest | size | class | is | very | high | and | therefore | even | a | small | change | in | the | average | number | of | animals | within | the | size | class | has | an | effect | The | largest | class | that | corresponding | to | 500 | or | more | LSUs | has | the | remaining | animals | whereby | the | sum | of | all | animals | matches | the | true | total

The | quantities | of | manure | nutrients | are | derived | from | Eurostat | 2017 | in | which | annual | manure | production | is | estimated | by | multiplying | animal | numbers | by | the | excretion | coefficients | per | animal | With | manure | being | a | substantial | input | in | the | total | nutrient | balance | excretion | coefficients | have | a | considerable | impact | on | the | final | outcome | It | should | be | pointed | out | that | excretion | coefficients | vary | widely | between | countries | In | part | this | reflects | differences | in | farming | practices | and | in | part | differences | stemming | from | the | methodology | applied | and | the | availability | of | data | for | calculating | the | coefficients | Eurostat | 2017 | Nitrogen | and | phosphorus | values | for | bovines | pigs | and | poultry | by | country | are | presented | in | Table | 3

The | quantities | of | manure | for | cattle | pigs | and | poultry | using | data | compiled | from | Luostarinen | 2013 | for | the | reference | years | 2009 | or | 2010 | The | amounts | of | slurry | and | solid | manure | are | tabulated | separately | in | the | case | of | cattle | and | pig | manure | Poultry | manure | is | all | in | essentially | solid | form | Table | 4

The | Markov | estimations | have | been | carried | out | using | data | on | aggregate | LSUs | per | farm | and | thus | the | exact | number | of | bovines | pigs | or | poultry | in | each | size | class | could | not | be | estimated | for | the | projected | years | Nutrients | per | LSU | in | each | size | class | were | determined | by | first | quantifying | the | totals | of | manure | nutrients | per | animal | species | using | Eurostat | 2017 | 4 | and | each | total | was | then | divided | by | the | total | number | of | LSUs | We | also | know | the | number | of | LSUs | by | animal | type | in | each | size | class | for | the | year | 2010 | which | yields | the | manure | nutrients | per | LSU | on | average | in | each | size | class | Table | 5 | Small | herds | tend | to | have | larger | coefficients | per | LSU | a | pattern | that | can | be | explained | with | reference | to | animal | species | 75 | of | animals | which | are | not | bovine | pigs | or | poultry | are | in | this | class | Variation | between | countries | is | smaller | between | large | herds | Overall | variation | in | average | kg | nutrient | per | LSU | unit | is | moderate

Coefficients | evolve | over | time | for | example | with | growth | in | productivity | or | changes | in | animal | feeding | and | farming | practices | Due | to | the | uncertainty | of | future | trends | we | use | fixed | excretion | coefficients | determined | from | 2010 | data | for | the | entire | period | The | nutrient | content | of | manure | produced | by | each | animal | is | the | same | in | all | farm | size | categories | but | where | the | distribution | of | animal | types | within | a | size | class | varies | the | nutrient | content | allocated | to | each | LSU | varies | correspondingly | Animal | types | within | size | categories | in | 2010 | are | presented | in | Fig | 2

The | projected | changes | in | farm | size | to | 2030 | are | calculated | using | on | the | discrete | probability | estimates | of | the | changes | The | figures | for | the | last | observed | year | of | farm | sizes | are | then | multiplied | annually | by | the | probabilities | of | a | change | in | farm | size | which | results | in | a | stationary | projection | of | farm | size | evolution | up | to | the | year | 2030 | and | a | projection | of | the | total | number | of | farms | having | livestock | The | number | of | production | animals | may | vary | however | as | the | largest | size | category | is | defined | as | over | 500 | LSU | Accordingly | the | estimate | of | the | total | number | of | animals | in | 2030 | had | to | be | obtained | from | another | source

Total | nitrogen | and | phosphorus | in | manure | by | animal | group | and | country | tons | Eurostat | 2017 | 2013 | and | have | more | variation | between | countries | than | nutrient | coefficients | Therefore | the | results | for | nutrient | quantities | are | more | reliable | than | those | for | manure | quantities

CAPRI | Common | Agricultural | Policy | Regionalised | Impact | model | is | a | comparative | static | partial | equilibrium | model | developed | for | global | and | regional | analysis | of | policy | and | market | impact | assessments | in | the | agricultural | sector | CAPRI | consists | of | two | main | interacting | components | the | first | is | agricultural | supply | for | the | EU | and | selected | European | countries | supply | module | the | second | a | global | equilibrium | model | for | agricultural | commodity | markets | market | module | Britz | and | Witzke | 2014 | In | the | supply | model | each | region | has | a | model | of | its | own | that | represents | all | agricultural | production | and | related | output | as | well | as | all | input | use | at | regional | level | Jansson | and | Heckelei | 2011

The | CAPRI | baseline | a | projection | made | under | a | specific | set | of | assumptions | represents | a | consistent | view | on | the | likely | evolution | of | global | agricultural | markets | over | some | future | time | horizon | The | baseline | reflects | the | evolution | of | key | variables | representing | the | production | of | the | agricultural | sector | in | a | ceteris | paribus | situation | The | main | exogenous | drivers | affecting | the | evolution | of | agriculture | include | agricultural | policies | and | macroeconomic | developments | e.g. | population | growth | GDP | growth | inflation | the | price | of | crude | oil | technological | change | and | policies | The | baseline | is | a | combination | of | expert | data | e.g. | from | FAO | OECD | the | European | Commission | the | World | Bank | other | research | teams | and | even | private | enterprises | and | simple | statistical | trends | in | data | contained | in | the | CAPRI | database | which | are | all | put | together | to | map | out | a | sound | development | path | Britz | and | Witzke | 2014 | The | current | baseline | assumptions | are | described | in | Espinosa | et | al | 2016 | Eurostat | 2016 | among | other | sources

In | the | present | case | CAPRI | only | serves | to | provide | an | external | reference | for | the | total | number | of | animals | in | each | region | for | the | years | 2010 | and | 2030 | We | utilized | the | baseline | scenario | with | CAP | policy | settings | for | the | period | 2014 | 2020 | The | results | of | total | regional | animal | numbers | and | production | volumes | were | obtained | from | the | years | 2010 | and | 2030 | Annual | estimates | for | years | between | 2010 | and | 2030 | were | not | used | as | a | discussion | of | variation | of | non | stationary | results | falls | out | of | the | scope | of | the | paper

FSS | data | provide | us | farm | LSUs | by | size | category | In | addition | to | being | able | to | estimate | the | changes | in | the | numbers | of | farm | animals | we | want | to | know | how | LSU | per | quantity | of | arable | land | i.e. | the | stocking | rate | LSU | ha | is | related | to | farm | size | This | is | important | when | thinking | of | solutions | to | the | problem | of | spatial | accumulation | of | manure | nutrients | If | stocking | rates | remain | unchanged | as | the | number | of | LSUs | increases | solutions | will | most | likely | involve | increasing | manure | utilization | within | the | farm | If | stocking | rates | decrease | with | increasing | sizes | solutions | must | be

a | Only | the | regions | DE8 | and | DEF | were | included | in | the | publication | DE4 | has | been | included | by | the | authors | sought | in | increased | coordination | of | manure | utilization | across | farms | that | is | in | the | agricultural | community | at | large | Unfortunately | FSS | data | do | not | enable | us | to | link | LSU | size | classes | with | the | amount | of | arable | land | available | on | a | farm | To | address | this | shortcoming | we | chose | to | use | data | from | the | Farm | Accountancy | Data | Network | FADN | covering | the | period | 2004 | -2015 | FADN | 2018 | which | allows | us | to | estimate | the | relationship | between | stocking | rate | and | number | of | animals | externally | and | generalize | the | estimated | coefficients | The | FADN | does | not | provide | farm | level | data | but | does | give | aggregate | numbers | of | livestock | and | area | used | for | agriculture | averaged | over | multiple | cross | classifications | such | as | farm | type | region | and | output | terms | The | measure | of | farm | size | in | the | FADN | data | is | an | economic | one | Standard | Output | SO | 5 | which | divides | farms | into | 6 | size | categories | according | to | the | economic | size | of | the | farm | Animal | numbers | are | strongly | correlated | with | SO | However | if | the | data | set | has | too | few | farms | per | crossclassified | category | the | average | of | that | particular | category | is | not | reported

We | utilized | relevant | production | types- | 1 | ruminants | milk | production | and | other | grazing | livestock | and | 2 | granivores | from | the | 8 | countries | and | 12 | years | cross | tabulated | over | the | SO | farm | sizes | Altogether | the | data | that | were | extracted | consisted | of | 801 | farm | aggregates | of | different | sizes | Table | 6

Finally | to | obtain | a | link | between | animal | numbers | and | arable | land | we | fitted | a | linear | ordinary | least | squares | OLS | model | to | estimate | stocking | rate | SR | LSU | ha | with | the | LSU | value | of | the | farm | aggregate | and | production | type | as | explanatory | variables | 4 | The | latter | was | included | as | a | dummy | variable | D | R | with | farms | engaged | in | milk | production | and | maintaining | other | grazing | livestock | receiving | a | value | of | 1 | and | granivore | farms | a | value | of | 0 | Stocking | rate | is | derived | as

where | β | 0 | is | a | constant | β | 1 | the | estimated | coefficient | for | livestock | units | and | β | 2 | is | the | estimated | coefficient | for | the | dummy | variable | representing | grazing | livestock

To | conclude | the | materials | and | methods | section | Table | 7 | presents | a | summary | of | the | main | data | sources | and | their | contribution | to | the | aims | set | for | the | research | that | is | to | 1 | put | forward | an | estimate | of | the | distribution | of | main | manure | nutrients | between | farms | of | different | sizes | 2 | to | estimate | how | this | distribution | will | change | in | the | near | future | and | 3 | to | discuss | the | land | use | effects | of | this | development

The | estimated | probabilities | of | the | observed | farm | size | transitions | from | 2003 | to | 2013 | are | presented | in | Table | 8 | Only | estimates | are | presented | because | opportunities | for | statistical | inference | are | very | limited | when | applying | a | macrodata | approach | This | is | why | most | macrodata | studies | do | not | provide | standard | errors | Huettel | and | Jongeneel | 2011

Estimated | development | of | farm | size | for | all | livestock | farms | is | presented | in | Fig | 3 | The | projection | indicates | that | there | will | be | a | drastic | increase | in | farm | size | in | the | eastern | countries | that | is | Latvia | Lithuania | and | Poland | with | the | expected | change | particularly | dramatic | in | the | last | These | countries | have | many | small | farms | the | number | of | which | has | already | decreased | considerably | Statistics | show | that | between | 2003 | and | 2013 | more | than | half | 1.1 | million | of | the | farms | in | these | countries | exited | livestock | production | According | to | our | estimate | some | 670,000 | more | livestock | farms | will | do | so | between | 2014 | and | 2030 | Fig | 3

CAPRI | generates | predictions | of | changes | in | regional | production | drawing | on | among | other | sources | differences | in | production | costs | between | regions | connected | by | trade | these | differences | lie | in | resource | availability | and | competitiveness | The | model | sets | restrictions | on | the | rate | of | regional | development

The | baseline | scenario | generated | by | CAPRI | shows | moderate | development | in | animal | numbers | the | outcomes | prompt | some | interesting | observations | The | total | number | of | bovines | is | projected | to | decrease | in | all | countries | except | for | regions | in | Northern | Germany | Some | of | the | decrease | can | be | attributed | to | the | predicted | increase | in | the | average | milk | yield | the | market | will | have | a | high | supply | of | milk | possibly | resulting | in | a | decrease | in | the | number | of | dairy | cows | and | in | turn | lower | calf | production | It | also | seems | that | the | number | of | pigs | will | decrease | in | most | countries | an | exception | being | Denmark | which | still | has | some | room | for | growth | It | is | estimated | that | growth | will | occur | in | all | countries | but | will | be | especially | robust | in | Poland | Table | 9

Combining | information | on | total | numbers | of | animals | with | the | estimate | of | farm | numbers | in | each | size | category | we | can | go | on | to | provide | an | estimate | of | how | the | total | is | distributed | across | farms | of | different | sizes | Fig | 4

According | to | our | estimates | roughly | 7.6 | million | LSUs | in | total | will | shift | to | farms | in | larger | size | classes | by | the | year | 2030 | This | would | entail | annual | investments | in | animal | housing | for | an | additional | 380,000 | LSUs | that | is | roughly | 2 | of | production | animals | would | change | farm | size | class | annually | The | total | number | of | animals | shows | only | a | slight | change | Looking | at | the | Polish | scenario | in | more | detail | we | see | that | 4.4 | million |  | LSUs | are | estimated | to | shift | to | farms | in | the | largest | size | class | over | 500 | LSUs | by | the | year | 2030 | This | would | mean | that | 64 | of | all | animals | will | be | on | farms | in | this | size | class | in | 2030 | In | Denmark | for | instance | 69 | of | LSUs | were | already | in | this | class | in | 2010

The | estimate | of | animal | numbers | in | the | different | size | categories | allows | us | to | further | tabulate | values | based | on | animal | numbers | We | start | from | total | manure | production | in | tons | which | seems | to | decrease | Fig | 5 | This | development | is | primarily | attributable | to | the | decrease | in | total | number | of | bovines

The | decrease | in | total | tons | of | nitrogen | can | also | be | seen | primarily | as | a | result | of | the | decrease | in | total | number | of | bovines | Fig | 6 | However | the | balance | between | nitrogen | and | phosphorus | seems | to | change | in | that | a | slight | increase | in | manure | phosphorus | is | expected | Fig | 7 | Here | too | distribution | by | country | differs | The | amount | of | phosphorus | in | manure | increases | in | Poland | 18.8 | million | tons | whereas | the | corresponding | quantity | decreases | in | all | other | countries | This | is | mainly | because | poultry |  | manure | has | a | high | phosphorus | content | and | the | CAPRI | baseline | predicts | a | relatively | large | increase | in | poultry | production | in | Poland

To | quantify | the | pressure | that | structural | change | will | cause | on | the | demand | for | agricultural | land | we | estimate | how | stocking | rate | measured | as | LSU | ha | is | related | to | the | number | of | animals | by | using | a | linear | regression | model | OLS | The | link | between | the | stocking | rate | and | farm | size | which | is | inferred | from | the | SO | classes | of | the | eight | different | countries | 801 | observations | was | best | explained | using | a | linear | model | with | a | dummy | variable | representing | ruminants | D | R | Table | 10 | The | overall | model | fit | R | 2 | was | 0.825

The | coefficients | indicate | that | the | average | stocking | rate | for | a | 100 | LSU | ruminant | farm | is | 2.627 | 100 | 0.003 | 1*(−2.105 | 0.822 | LSU | ha | and | similarly | 2.927 | LSU | ha | for | a | granivore | farm | The | estimate | indicates | that | an | increase | of | one | livestock | unit | is | associated | with | an | increase | of | 0.65 | ha | of | agricultural | land | in | the | case | of | ruminant | farms | milk | and | other | grazing | livestock | and | 0.27 | ha | in | the | case | of | granivore | farms

These | estimates | imply | that | on | average | ruminant | farms | produced | 130 | kg | of | manure | nitrogen | and | 19 | kg | of | manure | phosphorus | per | hectare | per | additional | LSU | The | corresponding | figures | for | granivore | farms | were | 139 | kg | of | N | and | 43 | kg | of | P | per | hectare | If | the | only | binding | regulation | on | nutrient | use | in | agriculture | is | the | Nitrates | Directive | which | only | requires | the | level | of | organic | manure | nitrogen | spread | per | hectare | to | be | 170 | kg | ha | in | the | vulnerable | zones | a | ruminant | farm | is | allowed | to | apply | average | of | 24.8 | kg | of | manure | phosphorus | per | hectare | and | a | granivore | farm | an | average | of | 53.1 | kg | of | phosphorus | per | hectare | with | average | manures | On | average | both | farm | types | have | ample | arable | land | to | meet | the | requirements | of | the | Nitrates | Directive | regarding | the | spreading | of | manure | With | average | manures | the | requirement | is | 0.49 | ha | per | 1 | ruminant | LSU | and | 0.22 | ha | per | 1 | granivore | LSU | 6 | This | approach | ignores | agronomic | constraints | and | concentrates | solely | on | the | regulatory | point | of | view | The | amount | of | area | required | by | the | projected | structural | development | is | presented | in | Table | 11

The | figures | indicate | that | the | overall | average | manure | spreading | area | for | a | livestock | farm | will | increase | from | 6.4 | to | 22.4 | ha | between | the | years | 2010 | and | 2030 | In | the | case | of | Latvia | the | average | spreading | area | of | the | large | farm | group | seems | to | decrease | a | result | of | many | expanding | farms | entering | the | class | and | compared | to | the | situation | in | 2010 | when | the | entire | class | had | no | more | than | a | few | very | large | farms | the | average | size | of | the | class | decreasing | In | total | growing | farms | need | to | acquire | 4.9 | million | hectares | from | exiting | farms | in | order | to | fulfil | the | current | manure |  | spreading | requirements | This | shift | represents | 64 | of | the | total | spreading | area | of | 2010 | and | 15 | of | the | total | utilized | agricultural | area | of | the | regions | studied | The | growing | farms | do | not | necessarily | have | to | acquire | the | land | they | require | and | place | them | under | their | own | management | if | cooperation | between | crop | and | livestock | systems | functions | smoothly

We | have | analysed | the | size | distributions | of | livestock | farms | in | eight | Baltic | Sea | littoral | countries | and | provided | a | scenario | for | their | development | by | 2030 | Our | results | show | that | structural | change | will | continue | to | shift | animal | production | to | larger | farms | with | this | in | turn | affecting | the | location | and | intensity | of | future | manure | nutrient | applications | Given | that | nutrients | in | animal | manure | are | the | dominant | pool | in | society | 's | nutrient | cycle | this | shift | should | be | addressed | in | future | regulatory | policies

We | have | estimated | the | structural | change | of | livestock | farms | using | a | stationary | Markov | chain | The | analysis | draws | on | combined | multiple | data | sources | to | disaggregate | bulk | statistics | on | agriculture | and | create | farm | size | categories | The | different | data | sources | proved | to | be | satisfactorily | comparable | even | though | the | statistics | were | collected | for | different | purposes | and | by | several | different | authorities

According | to | the | CAPRI | model | the | numbers | of | bovine | and | pig | animals | are | not | expected | to | grow | This | same | view | has | been | forward | by | for | example | OECD | FAO | 2017 | in | its | Agricultural | Outlook | for | 2017 | 2026 | which | is | taken | into | account | when | the | CAPRI | baseline | is | formed | However | productivity | in | both | subsectors | can | still | be | improved | whereby | production | volumes | can | be | partly | or | fully | maintained | with | a | lower | animal | population | particularly | in | the | case | of | dairy | farming

In | our | analysis | structural | change | is | captured | through | estimated | probabilities | that | a | farm | will | move | up | one | or | more | size | classes | or | exit | production | Interestingly | the | lowest | probability | 88 | of | staying | in | the | same | class | is | found | for | the | second | smallest | class | 50 | 99.99 | LSU | It | is | lower | than | that | for | the | smallest | class | 93 | This | might | reflect | the | fact | that | families | operating | the | smallest | farms | tend | to | have | income | outside | farming | However | running | a | farm | operation | with | 50 | LSUs | is | essentially | full | time | work | Hence | to | maintain | growth | in | family | income | and | productivity | such | farms | are | more | likely | to | either | grow | 4 | moving | to | a | higher | size | class | or | to | exit | livestock | production | 7 | and | find | another | way | to | make | a | living | Operations | in | the | highest | LSU | class | over | 500 | LSU | are | most | likely | to | stay | in | business | 95 | In | that | category | production | is | rarely | discontinued | entirely | even | when | the | farm | goes | bankrupt

The | biggest | increase | in | total | production | is | expected | in | poultry | production | This | is | an | ongoing | trend | in | which | most | of | the | growth | in | poultry | production | is | from | poultry | fattening | with | broiler | production | showing | the | highest | growth | 7 | New | investments | in | poultry | housing | tend | to | be | extensive | and | therefore | farms | making | such | investments | easily | end | up | in | the | top | size | class | if | they | are | not | there | already | MacDonald | 2008 | reported | a | similar | shift | in | US | broiler | operators | In | the | case | of | small | broiler | enterprises | the | household | 's | income | derived | primarily | from | offfarm | income | with | the | farm | providing | only | a | modest | amount | of | additional | income | For | larger | operations | the | enterprise | was | typically | the | primary | source | of | the | owning | household | 's | income | and | also | had | more | possibilities | to | finance | further | investments

The | change | in | the | number | of | farms | is | expected | to | be | most | pronounced | in | Poland | Using | Polish | data | from | the | year | 2000 | Latruffe | et | al | 2004 | estimated | that | the | size | efficiency | relationship | for | both | crop | and | livestock | farms | in | Poland | is | positive | given | that | large | farms | are | more | efficient | Based | on | observations | from | the | year | 2013 | Martinho | 2017 | concluded | that | there | are | still | inefficiencies | in | the | Polish | agricultural | sector | these | reflecting | the | unsustainable | economic | status | of | small | farms | In | this | light | it | seems | inevitable | that | structural | change | in | Poland | will | continue

We | linked | future | manure | nutrient | production | to | the | anticipated | structural | change | If | our | estimated | development | occurs | manure | will | be | produced | in | fewer | locations | but | in | larger | units | resulting | in | pressure | to | address | the | increasing | logistical | challenges | related | to | manure | The | FADN | sample | revealed | that | on | average | livestock | farms | currently | have | enough | arable | land | of | their | own | to | meet | the | requirements | of | the | Nitrates | Directive | on | manure | spreading | Having | sufficient | land | available | might | also | be | required | by | environmental | permits | regionally | However | if | only | nitrogen | spreading | is | regulated | higher | amounts | of | phosphorus | may | be | spread | in | granivore | manure | compared | to | the | typical | agronomic | needs | of | crops | In | the | future | estimate | if | only | nitrogen | spreading | is | regulated | the | total | area | for | manure | spreading | decreases | slightly | This | is | because | the | share | of | bovines | in | the | total | animal | population | is | expected | to | decrease | −5 | and | that | of | poultry | to | grow | 4

The | main | limitations | of | our | research | are | related | to | manure | nutrient | data | which | according | to | Eurostat | had | limited | reliability | This | could | be | seen | in | manure | nutrient | concentrations | which | varied | significantly | across | regions | and | countries | Although | some | variation | should | be | expected | due | to | differences | in | production | intensity | animal | breeds | and | cultivation | practices | the | reliability | and | comparability | of | manure | data | should | be | improved | through | improved | co | operation | between | countries | statistical | services

Our | structural | development | scenario | represents | business | as | usual | A | stationary | model | can | not | incorporate | policy | changes | or | market | shocks | in | the | analysis | Non | stationary | models | could | bring | elasticity | to | the | estimation | and | allow | scenario | estimates | with | different | price | and | demand | pathways | Also | provision | of | microdata | to | support | the | prior | assumptions | as | Zimmermann | and | Heckelei | 2012 | suggested | could | improve | reliability | of | the | results | However | even | if | future | research | applies | nonstationary | models | and | has | refined | prior | information | available | the | principal | arguments | we | have | put | forward | based | on | our | analysis | should | remain | qualitatively | unchanged

The | idea | of | disaggregating | sector | level | model | results | to | the | farmtype | level | is | not | new | The | farm | type | FT | extension | to | the | CAPRI | model | Gocht | and | Britz | 2011 | Gocht | et | al | 2012 | Espinosa | et | al | 2016 | Eurostat | 2016 | has | been | built | to | disaggregate | the | totals | of | the | agricultural | sector | to | farm | types | defined | by | 13 | farm | specialization | options | and | three | economic | size | options | for | all | regions | Production | in | each | region | is | disaggregated | to | the | number | of | farms | of | a | specific | farm | type | of | which | up | to | nine | are | selected | to | represent | each | region | in | the | dataset | according | to | their | importance | Simultaneous | dependence | which | means | that | decisions | on | investments | in | production | capacities | are | contingent | on | the | markets | and | vice | versa | between | the | ex | ante | analysis | of | structural | change | within | or | in | connection | to | a | partial | equilibrium | model | is | not | assessed | An | elaborated | CAPRI | FT | could | provide | a | foundation | for | a | similar | or | more | sophisticated | study | of | nutrient | disaggregation | to | farm | types | such | as | this | paper | has | presented

The | present | study | contributes | to | the | literature | by | detailing | one | possible | structural | change | scenario | for | the | development | of | livestock | farm | structure | in | eight | Baltic | Sea | littoral | countries | and | by | disaggregating | manure | nutrients | nitrogen | and | phosphorus | from | the | total | volume | of | production | into | LSU | based | farm | size | classes

The | EU | promotes | an | increase | in | farm | size | because | this | generally | leads | to | improved | productivity | A | substantial | change | has | already | taken | place | in | the | distribution | of | sizes | and | might | continue | in | the | near | future | While | this | trend | may | pose | a | challenge | where | nutrient | agglomeration | is | concerned | it | could | also | open | up | new | opportunities | for | manure | processing | these | would | emerge | due | to | critical | mass | accumulation | which | in | this | context | means | that | demand | for | manure | management | solutions | increases | in | areas | where | oversupply | of | manure | starts | to | cause | expenses | However | proper | recycling | of | nutrients | between | crop | and | livestock | production | systems | is | easier | if | farms | are | not | spatially | segregated | Structural | change | will | increase | demand | for | land | on | which | to | spread | manure | and | in | areas | where | expanding | farms | compete | against | each | other | for | this | land | prices | will | increase | and | the | overuse | of | manure | may | increase | as | well | The | risk | is | larger | in | the | case | of | granivore | farms | than | it | is | on | ruminant | farms | For | this | reason | it | is | important | to | maintain | livestock | production | in | many | agricultural | regions | Another | lesson | that | emerges | here | is | that | international | nutrient | use | policies | should | consider | the | evolution | of | farm | structure | in | undertaking | to | relieve | potential | agglomeration | problems | and | to | avoid | concentration | in | regions | where | environmental | conditions | are | poorest

The | parameter | estimates | for | P | and | w | t | with | constraints | 5 | 6 | 7 | and | 8 | are | obtained | by | numerically | maximizing | entropy | where | the | initial | value | of | w | itm | w | itm | 0 | and | the | initial | value | of | the | transition | probabilities | p | ij | q | ij | are | set | to | 0.0005,0.3333,0.3333,0.3333,0.0005 | by | the | estimation | algorithm

In | the | estimation | we | employed | the | additional | restrictions | on | the | transition | probabilities | that | are | defined | in | Table | 2 | at | chapter | 2.2

We | employ | a | discrete | time | Markov | chain | model | to | depict | the | changes | in | farm | size | over | time | The | model | has | five | different | states | four | corresponding | to | size | classes | and | the | fifth | indicating | entry | to | or | exit | from | livestock | farming | The | model | is | a | traditional | stationary | model | with | given | prior | information | which | comprises | observations | of | farm | sizes | for | each | country | from | the | years | 2003 | to | 2013 | Thus | we | estimate | a | separate | model | for | each | country | As | there | are | very | few | observations | over | time | we | use | the | generalized | maximum | entropy | GME | method | 8 | to | estimate | the | Markov | chain | model | The | transitions | between | time | points | t | and | t | 1 | and | within | and | between | the | five | classes | evolve | according | to | our | stationary | Markov | model | 5

for | all | i | 1 | 5 | and | t | 2003 | 2012 | These | constraints | guarantee | that | the | estimated | transition | matrix | P | contains | proper | transition | prob- | abilities | Note | that | the | first | observation | y | 2003 | is | an | initial | value | in | the | model | and | therefore | the | effective | sample | available | for | estimation | is | 10 | observations | transitions | We | rewrite | the | model | 1 | to | contain | all | these | ten | observed | transitions | in | the | data | 9 | where | Y | 10 | is | a | vector | of | 50 | elements | The | first | 10 | elements | contain | the | proportions | in | the | class | of | farms | with | fewer | than | 50 | animals | from | the | years | 8 | See | e.g. | Karantininis | 2002 | for | a | detailed | presentation | of | the | GME | estimation | method | and | the | stationary | Markov | chain | model | employed | here | 9 | In | the | SAS | ENTROPY | procedure | v= | −c,-c/2,0,c/2,c | where | a | large | c | is | chosen | Thus | m | 5 | and | the | five | support | points | and | prior | five | weights | are | selected | such | that | hypothesis | tests | can | be | performed | without | adding | significant | bias | to | the | estimation
