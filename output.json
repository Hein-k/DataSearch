        "text": "Livestock production in developed countries has undergone profound changes in recent decades and this development seems to continue apace. One consequence is that manure is being -and will be -produced on fewer but larger farms. Data on the bulk of manure nutrients from each country are published by Eurostat, but it is not known how manure is distributed across farms of different sizes. This study 1) puts forward an estimate of the distribution of main manure nutrients between farms of different sizes, 2) estimates how this distribution will change in the near future and 3) discusses the land use effects of this development. Results suggest that by the year 2030 farms housing > 500 livestock units will produce more than two-thirds of all manure phosphorus, whereas the proportion in 2010 was one-third. With the Nitrates Directive limiting the use of organic nitrate of manure, growing farms need to acquire, or conclude contracts for the use of, 4.9 million hectares from exiting farms or the open market in order to comply with manure spreading requirements. This shift will involve 64% of the total spreading area of 2010 and 15% of the total utilized agricultural area of the regions studied. In light of these predictions, international nutrient policies should consider the evolution of farm structure in general and manure phosphorus agglomeration in particular. Also salient is improved co-operation beyond the single farm level to ensure the functionality of crop-livestock systems.",

The productivity of the agricultural sector has increased at the same time as less intensive, mixed-farming systems that integrate crop and livestock production decline in many countries or regions (Peyraud et al., 2014). In the case of livestock production, specialization often means a transition to larger production units. It also increases the segregation of livestock and crop production areas (Gaign\u00e9 et al., 2011). On the one hand, specialization may strengthen the competitiveness of livestock production and promote innovations; on the other, it may hasten a transition toward monoculture and impede the supply of organic matter in the form of manure to crop production regions. Structural change may also alter the pressure that manure nutrients place on nutrient runoff and water quality by increasing the agglomeration of animals.",

Indeed, more nutrients tend to be imported into intensive animal production areas in the form of animal feed than are exported from them in the form of end products. This results in nutrient surpluses, which increase the risk of nutrient loading to surface and ground waters (Koelsch, 2005;Innes, 2000;Baerenklau et al., 2008).

Manure nutrients account for 34% of all nitrogen inputs and 51% of all phosphorus inputs used in agriculture.

Both continuous and discrete crop response models suggest that, ceteris paribus, the more animals there are in a production unit, the higher the rates at which manure will be applied in the manure application area (e.g. Innes, 2000;Schnitkey and Miranda, 1993;Iho et al., 2016). 1  As the trends described above suggest, the change in livestock production toward larger farms stands to increase the risk of local nutrient surpluses. Then again, large farms may have better opportunities than small ones to respond to the high transaction costs of environmental regulation, for example by adopting new technologies (see, e.g., Falconer, 2000). In short, while structural change creates risks of spatial nutrient accumulation and elevated runoff, it also offers opportunities to address these threats if the utilization of manure nutrients is regulated properly and coherently across national borders.",

Prior to 1989, farms in the Western Bloc developed under market-oriented systems and the common agricultural policy (CAP), which differed from the planned economies of the Eastern Bloc (Buchenrieder et al., 2009). Individual and rather small-scale farming have traditionally been the norm in Poland, whereas in the other Baltic countries, including Russia, many small farms were combined into large collective farms -kolkhozes or sovkhozes -at some point during the Soviet era (ibid.).

Our estimate of how the size of livestock farms will develop in the course of the next decade, until 2030, has been derived using a Markov chain model, which applies a stochastic approach assessing the probability that a farm will move among a set of discrete size classes (Zimmermann et al. 2012). The Markov results are combined with other data sources in order to visualize how the projected development will affect the allocation of manure nutrients between farms. The anticipated land use effects are discussed in conjunction with the relation between farm size and stocking rate.",

As most of Germany does not belong to the catchment area of the Baltic Sea, it was decided that only three NUTS 1 regions -the states Brandenburg (DE4), Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania (DE8) and Schleswig-Holstein (DEF) -would be included in the analysis. The animal numbers are measured in livestock units (LSU), applying the conversion coefficients used by Eurostat. 2  The years between FSS's have been retrieved from national statistics if available. 3 Years that we were unable to confirm or were not found nationally have been interpolated from FSS data by matching a thirddegree equation over the observed data points. The analysis focuses on three major animal groups -bovines, pigs and poultry -divided into four categories according to the size of the herd (Table 1).

One successful approach for modelling structural change is to estimate transition probabilities from one size class to another using Markov chain analysis. The probabilities can be further used to project development in the coming years. Transition probabilities are assumed to be stationary or non-stationary depending on whether they change over time. Many recent Markov chain studies rely on macrodata, with prior information used to improve estimation efficiency (e.g. Zepeda, 1995;Karantininis, 2002;Stokes, 2006;Tonini and Jongeneel, 2009;Huettel and Jongeneel, 2011;Ben Arfa et al., 2015). Zimmermann and Heckelei (2012) combined FADN microdata and FSS macrodata in estimating the probability of dairy farm transition. In their work, microdata provided prior information on changes in farm size, which they applied in estimating the macrodata.",

In the projection, we took this into account by estimating a linear trend describing the behaviour of the observed data, which indicated that the average number of animals in each size class increases slightly each year. The change within a particular class is limited, however, given that when farms with < 50 LSUs start to grow, they quickly move up into the next size class (50 \u2264 LSU \u2329100). Similarly, in the (50 \u2264 LSU < 100 LSU) and (100 \u2264 LSU < 500) classes, when a farm increases in size, it moves into a higher class. Taking minor growth within a class into account with the trend is important in the case of Poland, for example, where the number of farms in the smallest size class is very high and therefore even a small change in the average number of animals within the size class has an effect. The largest class, that corresponding to 500 or more LSUs, has the remaining animals, whereby the sum of all animals matches the true total.",

Interestingly, the lowest probability (88%) of staying in the same class is found for the second-smallest class (50-99.99 LSU). It is lower than that for the smallest class (93%). This might reflect the fact that families operating the smallest farms tend to have income outside farming. However, running a farm operation with > 50 LSUs is essentially full-time work. Hence, to maintain growth in family income and productivity, such farms are more likely to either grow (4% moving to a higher size class) or to exit livestock production (7%) and find another way to make a living. Operations in the highest LSU class (over 500 LSU) are most likely to stay in business (95%). In that category, production is rarely discontinued entirely, even when the farm goes bankrupt.",

This is an ongoing trend in which most of the growth in poultry production is from poultry fattening, with broiler production showing the highest growth.7 New investments in poultry housing tend to be extensive and therefore farms making such investments easily end up in the top size class if they are not there already. MacDonald ( 2008) reported a similar shift in US broiler operators. In the case of small broiler enterprises, the household's income derived primarily from offfarm income, with the farm providing only a modest amount of additional income. For larger operations, the enterprise was typically the primary source of the owning household's income and also had more possibilities to finance further investments.",

If our estimated development occurs, manure will be produced in fewer locations but in larger units, resulting in pressure to address the increasing logistical challenges related to manure. The FADN sample revealed that on average livestock farms currently have enough arable land of their own to meet the requirements of the Nitrates Directive on manure spreading. Having sufficient land available might also be required by environmental permits regionally. However, if only nitrogen spreading is regulated, higher amounts of phosphorus may be spread in granivore manure compared to the typical agronomic needs of crops. In the future estimate, if only nitrogen spreading is regulated the total area for manure spreading decreases slightly. This is because the share of bovines in the total animal population is expected to decrease (\u22125%) and that of poultry to grow (4%).",

Production in each region is disaggregated to the number of farms of a specific farm type, of which up to nine are selected to represent each region in the dataset according to their importance. Simultaneous dependence (which means that decisions on investments in production capacities are contingent on the markets and vice versa) between the ex-ante analysis of structural change within or in connection to a partial equilibrium model is not assessed.

A substantial change has already taken place in the distribution of sizes and might continue in the near future. While this trend may pose a challenge where nutrient agglomeration is concerned, it could also open up new opportunities for manure processing: these would emerge due to \"critical mass\" accumulation, which in this context means that demand for manure management solutions increases in areas where oversupply of manure starts to cause expenses. However, proper recycling of nutrients between crop and livestock production systems is easier if farms are not spatially segregated. Structural change will increase demand for land on which to spread manure, and in areas where expanding farms compete against each other for this land, prices will increase and the overuse of manure may increase as well. The risk is larger in the case of granivore farms than it is on ruminant farms. For this reason, it is important to maintain livestock production in many agricultural regions. Another lesson that emerges here is that international nutrient use policies should consider the evolution of farm structure in undertaking to relieve potential agglomeration problems and to avoid concentration in regions where environmental conditions are poorest.",
